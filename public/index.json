[{"content":"Long time folks, I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly moved to YouTube and Patreon\u0026hellip; but *sometimes* I do remember this small corner of the internet. I swear I need to get some tools in place to help me manage all of the stuff I am putting together\u0026hellip; but that requires *more time*\u0026hellip;\nI\u0026rsquo;d rather spend my time actually responding to valuable questions and helping people out than writing a rant like this, but\u0026hellip; here we are\u0026hellip;\nThose of you who know me understand that I really don\u0026rsquo;t care to waste my time. When I make time to do something I try and put my full energy and effort into it. If something or someone seems to be wasting time, I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to address it, to make sure it is no longer a problem, and from there I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best to ignore it. Consider this another attempt to address it.\nIn life though, there\u0026rsquo;s always going to be those things trying to waste your time. I won\u0026rsquo;t bore you with a list of things\u0026hellip; just know that some people\u0026rsquo;s behavior is very good at it, and they probably don\u0026rsquo;t even recognize it in themselves.\nI recently received a comment on YouTube of the \u0026ldquo;not valuable\u0026rdquo; sort. It said\nTo give full context, the individual in question had asked a rather uninformed/basic question about some music hardware, and I do strive to respond to people in general as I have time and as I see fit. I do try and answer top level comments in due time, but I don\u0026rsquo;t always have free time to reply to everybody, and the more popular my channel becomes, the harder it is to respond to everybody. To make it more complex, any top level comments are easy for me to find through Google\u0026rsquo;s tools, but the deeper a thread goes, the more I wish people would start a conversation on my Discord server because YouTube does not have the tools to manage comment threads.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have exact statistics, but I believe my general response time is around one to two weeks. This varies based on my free time, how long it takes me to setup videos, do research, how busy my work schedule is, events or priorities with my family, what I have planned for the weekend, and a multitude of other factors in my life.\nI\u0026rsquo;m conflicted about what to do with something like this. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to flame the person in question, but I do want to highlight the general attitude that some people have, because this is a pretty deeply coded message, even if the intent was not there. It\u0026rsquo;s also super easy to read too much into this as plain text obviously doesn\u0026rsquo;t have all the nuances of in person human language, and leaves it up to the reader to extrapolate from there.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s hit the bullet points though\nOdd level of insecurity about their previous message There is a level of passive aggressiveness here, no threats, but still feels like a form of bullying In this message there is a level of entitlement as if I owe the person a response, while I may do this, I owe this person nothing Finally this is a ham fisted demand for me to reprioritize my time, that I do give for free, to them. Overall, I personally find this to be a rather immature way to seek attention. It is a lazy attempt to get me to reprioritize my effort, and it offers nothing in return. I would suggest a much better approach would have been something along the lines of \u0026ldquo;it would mean a lot to me if you could respond to my other message\u0026rdquo; or even offering me something (not even money) for my time.\nWhy offer something when I am \u0026ldquo;giving it away for free\u0026rdquo;? Why I\u0026rsquo;m so glad you asked dear reader. I typically pick up the most interesting things \u0026ldquo;to me\u0026rdquo; to talk about or discuss. Or, if I already have something setup for a video shoot, and just need a few adjustments, I\u0026rsquo;ll move onto something that is easy \u0026ldquo;for me\u0026rdquo; to record. You might notice a bit of a theme here, but it is about \u0026ldquo;me\u0026rdquo;.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a layer of \u0026ldquo;hey jerk pay attention to me\u0026rdquo; as well, that I just find distasteful. I get that the person is irritated or upset that I haven\u0026rsquo;t responded to them yet, but on the flip side I owe this person nothing. I am not about providing instant gratification to people in general, and I am not providing any kind of \u0026ldquo;paid for\u0026rdquo; service that would give anybody some kind of expectation that I even should respond. There\u0026rsquo;s a kind of bullying behavior here\nYou might ask yourself \u0026ldquo;What am I supposed to do with this?\u0026rdquo; If I respond to the original message, I am just setting a poor precedent that the best way to get my attention is to keep pestering me until I respond, which just further wastes my time. I don\u0026rsquo;t want this behavior, and frankly, I would rather take the time to just delete these kinds of messages if they become a nuisance.\nSo\u0026hellip; spending some of my free time making YouTube videos to help teach people about music does have the side effect of receiving unwanted attention. It is par for the course. The more public you make your life, the more people feel they have something you owe them, or perhaps that they know you well enough that they can ask for anything. This just leads to both positive, negative, and everything in between for comments.\nI give nearly all of the music related content I make away for free, this is because I see the value for others in giving more to the community than I expect in return. As an odd side effect, the more I give away for free, the more people think they can be pushy to get what they want out of me. I know the value of my time though, and I know it is definitely not zero. To put it a different way, I choose to educate where I can for free because I enjoy helping people out, and I know in general most people could not afford my time.\nI have had a very small group of people ask how much it would cost for me to give them personal lessons. Out of this already small group, very few people have actually had the funds to afford sessions with me. As much as possible I have offered to make public material for them to see if I can help them (and others) for free as much as possible.\nI may provide this service for free, and I may prioritize certain aspects of it within my life, but there are very very few people in this sphere of my life that I would reshuffle my day around for in their interest. There are some, and they know who they are\u0026hellip; but random people on the internet?\nAt the end of the day, my time is my time. How I choose to use my free time, unless we\u0026rsquo;ve worked a deal out, is fully up to me.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2025/08/05/dont-waste-my-free-time-my-time-is-not-free/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLong time folks, I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly moved to YouTube and Patreon\u0026hellip; but *sometimes* I do remember this small corner of the internet.

There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of cool gear out there, and certainly not enough free time to cover it all. That said, I do try and keep the Guide going as new thoughts come to mind.\nFor those of you downloading this\u0026hellip; I had started a Koala integration section a while ago, but I got distracted. The integration is cool and all, but it feels kind of half baked from my usage of it. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of features and functionality that overlap between the two, but they both manage to offer enough new that I do think it is cool. Unfortunately for me, and my interest levels, I keep finding oddities in how the two integrate together that make it feel like a nice start, but not a seamless integration. I\u0026rsquo;ll likely get around to adding more to the guide about it, but I\u0026rsquo;m just warning you, that there are a lot of stubs and placeholders for things I was considering writing about, and not really a whole lot of content about how or why to do things.\nYou might wonder why release this update at all then? Well I fairly regularly get questions around BPM issues with the SP404 mk2, and that it does act in odd and inconsistent ways. There was a recent conversation over on the Elektronauts SP404 mk2 forum thread that I figured it might be worth its own section in the guide. I waffled on how to even format the information, but honestly, I just started typing and came up with what ultimately felt like it was worth an Appendix. Something that stays out of the way of people just learning the device, but a section you can heat when you want to do a deep dive on what in the world is going on with BPM values.\nOver the BPM Breakdown section, I tried to go over what the different BPM values are used for, what the priority order of them is from my own testing, and tried to point out any interesting things you might be able to do with effects or other settings. It\u0026rsquo;s certainly not covering everything, but if you do feel that something is missing or could be added to this section feel free to reach out and I\u0026rsquo;ll gladly look into it to see how I might be able to fit it in.\nAs always, thanks for hanging out, asking questions, and just being a cool bunch of people!\nNearTao\u0026rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.36 Download\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/11/02/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-36/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMost importantly (for me at least) is I\u0026rsquo;m still kicking!

What\u0026rsquo;s happened in between? Well I dropped the Quick Reference for the SP404 mk2, which was a lot of fun to make, but super time consuming. Plus within just a few days of releasing it, Roland dropped the 4.04 firmware update. I decided to invest the effort into updating the Quick Reference for 4.04 rather than the guide, and then I sunk time into getting some 4.04 videos out.

I may decide to go back and put these more minor updates up on the blog when I drop all the other content, but for now, I\u0026rsquo;m just getting v0.33 out there. For those with thoughts though, let me know.\nYou all have been playing with 4.04, and while the update isn\u0026rsquo;t as huge in some ways as previous updates (at least to document), I do feel like there are a number of things that are more impactful for people to work in new ways. Looper is probably the standout feature in my mind from a \u0026ldquo;just get different cool stuff done\u0026rdquo;, but it is kind of a bummer to lose Skipback.

It doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel quite as fully realized as I\u0026rsquo;d like it to, but for what it is, it certainly is fine.

I got an email that congratulated me for being in the top 2% of earners for buymeacoffee.com. Before you all start celebrating me and my \u0026ldquo;wild success\u0026rdquo;, I\u0026rsquo;m going to drop some details, some thoughts, and probably a few opinions.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with where I am today. My online digital \u0026ldquo;footprint\u0026rdquo; is kind of a mess, where I have accounts for all kinds of services, and I sort of know why I put some content somewhere, but also feel like I\u0026rsquo;m probably spread a bit too thin if I was trying to make a living out of all of this. I\u0026rsquo;m not really trying to make a living out of all of this, so that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing, but due to my \u0026ldquo;anti-capitalistic\u0026rdquo; behavior, I also get a peek into understanding why all this social media stuff is so hard from time to time.\nWhat sites?\nThe most used accounts are probably on YouTube, Wordpress, BuyMeACoffee, Discord, and Patreon. I\u0026rsquo;ve also got accounts on Instagram, X, SoundCloud, and a bunch of other social media. I\u0026rsquo;ll post tracks or other random things on SoundCloud from time to time, but besides having other sites post stuff \u0026ldquo;on my behalf\u0026rdquo; to Instagram or X, or what have you, they don\u0026rsquo;t get much use from me. If I was trying to hustle and make serious money from all of the work I\u0026rsquo;ve put in, I\u0026rsquo;d be out there advertising, adding \u0026ldquo;buy whatever\u0026rdquo; bumpers to all my videos, and chasing all the latest trends that I could get my hands on.\nFor anybody that has paid attention to what I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on over the last\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; decade or so now?\u0026hellip; In the past I have used YouTube and SoundCloud mostly interchangeably, as a place to post music. I would, in the past, post pretty frequent blog posts on this Wordpress site with whatever thoughts, learning lessons, or whatever else came to mind. I\u0026rsquo;d post information about the MPC, maybe the SP202 or SP303, the OP-1, or whatever else rather sporadically. In general, these videos are posts were to help answer folks who had questions on various forums, and it felt like a more direct way to answer somebody to help them out.\nWhat changed?\nFor starters, I got burnt out by watching a lot of the music YouTubers out there just chasing whatever the new \u0026ldquo;hotness\u0026rdquo; was. It was probably more of a \u0026ldquo;me not you\u0026rdquo; mental change, but I just was getting exhausted with the hyper aggressive very market focussed change. Broadly, it felt to me like a lot of successful YouTubers had pivoted from caring about instruments and their fan base to caring about how to get free gear or how to make a buck. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to throw shade on anybody, but it was disheartening to watch, and honestly continue to watch. That said, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to call somebody a shill, heck I\u0026rsquo;ve been called one from time to time for all the SP404 mk2 I\u0026rsquo;ve made\u0026hellip; so what do I know.\nAround this time, I started taking a lot of notes about the SP404 mk2, and thought about turning it into a guide, just trying to give as much truthful and factual information as possible, and couple it with as much personal experience or why I think something was important or useful as possible. Honestly, I did it for *me*, but I wanted to give it out to the community for free. I know I\u0026rsquo;ve talked about this before, but I put it out there for free for two main reasons. First, I believe strongly in education and helping others, and I felt that by doing this for free the guide could have a broad impact on people being able to express themself. Second, there\u0026rsquo;s a level of ownership that others have when they pay you for something that I just didn\u0026rsquo;t want. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I want to keep my hands up and push people away or anything, but to be able to do things on my own time requires or in my own voice, not attached to a dollar value requires me to do a lot of this work for free.\nAnyways, about two and a half years ago, when the SP404 mk2 released, I saw some really shady \u0026ldquo;masterclass\u0026rdquo; style SP404 mk2 content get released as paid content, and it felt super low quality, and honestly didn\u0026rsquo;t seem very engaging. I really felt that even with low production values on my part, I could do better. Also, why not just iteratively learn *how* to get better at doing these kinds of things. Anybody who goes back to my older videos will know that the audio is rather poor (being generous), but I\u0026rsquo;m hoping the newer content comes across that much better today. I\u0026rsquo;m also not trying to get the best shots, or improve cameras, or worry about lighting. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t been the point for me. Sure it could get more views if I do all that, but then I\u0026rsquo;ll be worried about recovering money for my investment.\nWhere Are We Today?\nIt is like a link soup all of this. Heck I\u0026rsquo;m just going to just post what I had said over at Elektronauts ( https://www.elektronauts.com/t/roland-sp-404-mk2-part-2/211287/690)\nhttps://buymeacoffee.com/neartao The Buy Me A Coffee shop was setup with some downloadable items listed. I can set the prices as low as $1 (maybe even $0) which is nice, though file upload limits are annoying. I’ve put together some sound sets and things, and most of the descriptions have links to go to if you want to download some (or in some cases all) of the content for free. I’m mostly putting these sound sets here as a place to aggregate some of the things I’ve done over the years that might start to get harder to find. I’m also paying for probably too many hosting services and will at some point try and collapse down to a smaller number of systems.\nneartao.wordpress.com/2023/12/11/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-29/ One of the services I pay for… Wordpress. It’s not unbelievably pricey, but is really just a place I generally just upload files to lately instead of blogging. The link goes to the latest “freely available” guide, it covers version 3.x. People from time to time reach out and ask how to support me, and I’ve settled on publishing interim “incomplete” or “minor update” versions of the guide to my Patreon for subscribers only… I am in the process of updating the guide to firmware 4.04… but subscribers can get the minor updates as they happen…\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/neartaos-sp404-4-101911920 The Patreon link should take you directly to the freely available quick reference. It’s pretty easy for most people to print out and make themselves, and I’ve posted a YouTube video on how to do it. There is a link for a paid version over at BuyMeACoffee, which exists entirely outside of Patreon because as far as I can tell, there isn’t a good way to ask a questionnaire for things like shipping address. I’m charging $10 to make the quick reference by hand and ship it out. On Patreon there isn’t really a good way to charge “less than $5” for most anything… and it looks like a hassle to have custom forms when people buy something… between Patreon and BuyMeACoffee I feel like I can get most of the “low cost” and “hassle free” and heck even “give stuff away for free”, but neither has proven to be a one stop shop for what I am trying to do… which is mostly get information out there, and let people pay what they want, if anything.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/neartao My YouTube channel is where you’ll probably find the most consistent updates. I seem to get the most questions and things here, and I have in the past tried to stick to posting at least one video a day. It has gotten a bit harder to keep up, and I’m just getting around to posting videos on the 4.04 firmware update, but it’s still going along.\nhttps://discord.gg/MH2uG45x I’ve got a discord server going as well… pretty sleepy, though from time to time questions get asked or I’ll make some time to hop onto voice chat and answer questions. Honestly, it’s mostly used as a table top rpg server for a few games I run with some friends, but I’m always happy to hang out with anybody if I’ve got the time.\nWhy All This?\nAs you can read from above, I haven\u0026rsquo;t really settled on any single way to provide a service or anything. It is nice to get a bit of passive income out of all the work I\u0026rsquo;ve put in, but I\u0026rsquo;d also rather keep as much goodwill with the community I have built as it were. Which means I get a handful of donations from various places from time to time, and for that I am grateful that somebody would care enough to drop a few dollars for anything. I\u0026rsquo;d prefer to pull everything together into a single donation, subscription, or other service, but all of these services have their hand out in various ways. YouTube wants you to have memberships to give early access to videos. I get it they want you to go through them so they can get their piece of the pie, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather use something like Patreon or BuyMeACoffee to manage other services as well more broadly. Patreon offers a video service, but then I need to transcode videos to a different format, which has its own hassles. BuyMeACoffee would be a great platform instead of Patreon, but it has a file size limit around 180-200mb or something, which breaks a lot of content I\u0026rsquo;d like to publish.\nWhich leaves me spreading myself thinner across all of these services. Which I guess I\u0026rsquo;ll continue to shrug to for now.\nPassive Income Breakdown\nMaybe this is what you wanted to come here for, to see behind the scenes a bit.\nYouTube Channel\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at YouTube videos for starters. I\u0026rsquo;ve posted well over 730 videos, that are generally 5-8 minutes long. I\u0026rsquo;ll be generous and say that they are 5 minutes. On average I record a video about 1.3 times (sometimes I nail it the first time, sometimes I do a few takes). I try to respond to questions and comments in each video which might account for about 7 minutes per video. It also takes me about 10 minutes to upload, write in the descriptions, fill out forms and all of that. I\u0026rsquo;ll break down the math for time investment per video as (5m * 1.3) + 7m + 10m per video, or about 23.5 minutes invested per video. 23.5 minutes * 730 videos works out to bout 17,155 minutes or 286 hours of time investment, just on the YouTube channel.\nOver the last year, well 17 months, I have made about $20-$60 in advertisement revenue for the videos per month. I\u0026rsquo;d guess that the average is about $40, which is maybe $480 a year. It\u0026rsquo;s not bad, but works out to about $1.67 per hour, for my (probably low balled) investment of time. I know I\u0026rsquo;m not \u0026ldquo;trying\u0026rdquo; in the traditional sense to make a YouTube career, but those kinds of numbers are pretty terrible, and makes me better understand why YouTubers who are trying to make a living out of this swing into doing whatever is trendy in the moment, and ultimately burning out because I\u0026rsquo;d imagine they are putting in far more time and money, and might not be getting much better of an investment out of it for themself.\nThe SP404 mk2 Guide\nThe guide honestly, is going to be much worse to break down, but mostly because anything that has a zero in it is going to be terrible, and I do charge zero for it. Still, I don\u0026rsquo;t think a lot of people appreciate the amount of time that has gone into that either, but my rough estimate is that it takes about two hours per page on average to write, edit, update, and maintain. The current state of the guide is about 180 pages I think, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if it was about 360 hours of work over the last two and a half years. The upfront cost was high to actually get it to 1.x, and both 2.x and 3.x brought in substantial changes. I\u0026rsquo;m in the middle of updating the guide to 4.04, and there\u0026rsquo;s just so many things to check and proofread, that the time does add up. So I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if it\u0026rsquo;s at least another 40-80 hours to get all of the updates in place for the 4.04 version of the guide, and beyond a few BuyMeACoffee donations (maybe $60\u0026rsquo;ish), I haven\u0026rsquo;t really gotten much out of it.\nI do get people who reach out to me from time to time about publishing a physical copy of the guide, but I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, just to pay for a trial run of it, or to pay for some test copies to see how it looks, just makes the proposition worse. Especially when I\u0026rsquo;d expect to see around 10-20 sales at best, and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be charging an arm and a leg for it. Could I be convinced that there\u0026rsquo;s a way to do it? Perhaps, but I don\u0026rsquo;t really see a sane way to do it, when my philosophy has been to keep costs as low as possible.\nAcid Drop Release\nI spent *so* much time working on this sample pack. Not as much as the guide or YouTube videos, but checking notes and such, this was over 60 hours worth of time to sample, create patches, create patterns, and package everything. I was hoping it\u0026rsquo;d be something that might generate some real sales and interest, and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a total of 9 sales, at $5 a pop. Now remember, I\u0026rsquo;m not advertising these things much, and I\u0026rsquo;m mostly doing these things for myself, but this was definitely a real bummer for me. I clearly had the wrong mindset going into it though, which is fine, but it is also the space where I\u0026rsquo;m happy to give a lot of things away for free, but when I do that I obviously cannot be belly aching about why nobody is buying content later. So I have to give it a bit of a shrug and move on.\nQuick Reference\nThis was another project where I\u0026rsquo;ve just taken a ton of notes over the last two years, and was always trying to figure out how to put something together that might be useful for other people as well. While I haven\u0026rsquo;t been big on publishing the guide, I figured a quick reference would actually be manageable for me to sell. The initial quick reference was about 30 hours to put together, between formatting, organizing, and redoing notes, and to update it for 4.04 was nearly another 40 hours due to how much I overhauled the look and feel, had to find space, and all of that fun stuff. So the quick reference, for literally being only 2 printed pages, is probably per page, my biggest investment in time.\nI had considered making it a \u0026ldquo;for sale only\u0026rdquo; thing, but\u0026hellip; and I must be a glutton for punishment, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d put it out there for free to help people out, and to have for sale a physical copy. Even with the quick reference I understand that $10 is extravagant, especially for a single piece of paper, that I am giving away for free as well, plus the $10 includes all of the labor to print it, fold it, staple it, cut it, put it into an envelope, and pay for postage. I don\u0026rsquo;t think most people understand just how manually intensive something like this is, especially when you get one off sales. At this point I\u0026rsquo;ve sold 11 of them, and it is far more than I thought would sell based on previous trends for everything, but also far less than I was afraid of. When I launched it, I was concerned I\u0026rsquo;d get over 100 orders and be manufacturing these little booklets for a week.\nWhat about the 2%\nWell\u0026hellip; back here now\u0026hellip; I got an email from BuyMeACoffee that said I was in the top 2% of earners on BuyMeACoffee. If you\u0026rsquo;ve done the math, you can probably take a stab at a total, but I think I\u0026rsquo;ve still made under $200 total on this site. If you take out expenses for buying envelopes, stamps, paper, toner, and everything else, well I am well below $200. If you consider that BuyMeACoffee, and the credit card companies get a cut of every sale as well, all I can say is, how is anybody making money out here?\nAt no point did this email make me think \u0026ldquo;wow I\u0026rsquo;ve made it\u0026rdquo;, instead it more got me thinking, just how many struggling people are out there? Or maybe the site is full of bots trying to scam people out of money? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, but it\u0026rsquo;s all kind of sad thoughts for me, because I know how much work and effort I\u0026rsquo;ve put into all of this to get a tiny amount of recognition. All I can say is that I\u0026rsquo;m glad I\u0026rsquo;m not attaching any personal meaning for doing any of this work to a dollar value, because frankly, if I were, I\u0026rsquo;d go insane from the grind.\nAll of this also does have me considering that I will keep Patreon and BuyMeACoffee going. I do want to find ways to put content out there for free, but also have some things that if people think they\u0026rsquo;d like to toss a coin or two my way that they can help support in some way and still get something out of it. For now at least I still feel like putting sound sets together, writing the guide, and trying to help people out. It\u0026rsquo;s fun and I do feel like the community has been great.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2024/05/10/in-the-top-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is a weird one for me for sure.

There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interesting paid software, open source software, and a lot of opinions of what is best to use, how they integrate together. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot to dig through, but understanding others\u0026rsquo; experience with a tool is certainly helpful.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used Atlassian Jira, Redmine, Microsoft Project, Smartsheets, Bugzilla (though this was a freakish hack), text files, Cultured Code Things, Apple Reminders, and a boat load of other options.\nRequirements Honestly, for my personal use I\u0026rsquo;ve got a few requirements, some of which I am learning conflict with each other.\nFree or single time license purchase Cross environment sync\u0026rsquo;ing Offline Access Home/on-premise deployment Multiple user accounts About five years ago, I was definitely able to do this with several different solutions. Today though, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to find that the project management marketplace has moved in a different direction.\nLicensing Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the single time license purchase, because it is probably the most straightforward. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to have to pay a monthly subscription, I already have enough of those. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to get a clear and straight value out of it unless you use it all the time, and I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sure that for my use case I\u0026rsquo;m going to get *that* much use out of it.\nSyncing I\u0026rsquo;d like to have something that can sync projects and tasks across devices, such as my computer and my phone. This will allow me to work on projects where I am at. Some solutions don\u0026rsquo;t seem to allow for this kind of workflow though, unless you\u0026rsquo;re willing to setup email as a way to spam yourself with reminders. I\u0026rsquo;m on the fence on this one, but since I\u0026rsquo;m considering setting up a business and I would like a way to assign work to people beside myself, it would be nice.\nOffline Access Besides syncing, which can sort of be done through cloud or online apps, I\u0026rsquo;d like to be able to get access to project details while I am not connected. It\u0026rsquo;s tough when you have a network outage or don\u0026rsquo;t have a good network connection to get access to information sometimes, and being able to work offline is nice.\nOn-premise This is a nit of mine, but I am getting tired of everybody having better access to my own data than me. Plus, I wanted to be able to get some more time putting into sys admin and deployments. Setting up my own instance seems like it has a lot of value to me for multiple reasons.\nMultiple Accounts If I want to turn any of my work into a potential business, I\u0026rsquo;ll likely need to hire people at some point. To be able to hire people you need to be able to assign them work. If a system doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow multiple accounts, then you get stuck unable to assign work without a lot of copying and pasting.\nAtlassian Jira I used to be a Jira admin, and was really considering setting this up at home. I was excited to see where things had progressed with Atlassian lately. Years ago, for a startup I had setup Jira and Bamboo, and had a really nice automated system running to allow for task creation, agile workflows, and it was all neatly integrated with Bamboo to run builds, and file bugs against builds. It took some work, but it generated a rich amount of reports and information. I had created a similar setup for things at home using a 10 person license, that I believe was $15 a month, for Jira, Confluence, and Bamboo. Sadly, the Bamboo license was more expensive to do anything terribly fancy with the builds, so I abandoned it.\nAt any rate, I still had my Atlassian account, and figured I would investigate pricing, and was surprised that their 10 user license was now free. Unfortunately, it is only free if you take their hosted SaaS solution, as they have discontinued their low cost licensed software. Maybe in the future I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit using Jira, but for the time being I think I\u0026rsquo;ll pass on it.\nRedmine My first exposure to this was actually at my last job. When I started, there was no documentation, templates, or other efforts in place to help streamline work, and there was no budget to put anything into place either. I ended up taking the time to setup a Redmine server, create accounts, and get information deployed into it. I know it well enough that I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would be too hard to deploy, even if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t terribly in love with the solution. Plus this was around ten years ago now, so it has probably grown up a lot.\nMy Synology used to have a Redmine option under Package Center, but it looks like this was removed somewhat recently. After doing a bit of research, it appears that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t well maintained and was several versions out of date. I investigated deploying a container, but it looked like it was more trouble than it was worth. For the moment, I\u0026rsquo;ll go with my instincts and just assume it isn\u0026rsquo;t really what I am looking for and move on.\nMS Project No thanks\u0026hellip; and I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in MS Teams either.\nThings I\u0026rsquo;d use this, because it checks off just about all of my boxes, but there\u0026rsquo;s no multi user solution. It is purely a personal project/task manager. So for now it\u0026rsquo;s actually just what I need, but for the future it\u0026rsquo;s going to fall flat for me. I might have to give it some more thought depending on where other options land though.\nReminders This, or Notes from Apple might not be *too* bad in some ways, but it hits all the issues you\u0026rsquo;re going to have with a text file. Lots of work to put up front to assign tasks, requires a lot of \u0026ldquo;agreements\u0026rdquo; between parties for how you want to manage it, and at the end of the day requires somebody to have an Apple device. So\u0026hellip; probably not going to work the way I want it to.\nOpenProject I did deploy this on my Synology in a container, and it was a bit janky, but I got it to work well enough. My broader concern though is that the majority of interesting workflows such as Kanban are locked behind an Enterprise subscription. Sorry, but I\u0026rsquo;m not interested in a subscription, and if I was I\u0026rsquo;d probably just go with Jira, since I know that software quite well.\nKanboard This is what I\u0026rsquo;ve ended up deploying as a container on my server. It is a bit simple, and missing some of the nicer flair of other options, but this is just project management. How much do you need? I\u0026rsquo;m going to play around with this for now and see how it works for me. If nothing else I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure that I can go back to Things and see how it compares, but I do know that I need to get out of having all these sticky notes, text file docs, and other paper trails that are getting difficult to follow.\nComparison Just a quick chart for what I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed, and while it has a bunch of gaps, it definitely has shown me that I\u0026rsquo;m unlikely to find a single perfect solution.\nSubscriptionSyncingOfflineOn-PremMulti UserJiraYes??????NoYesRedmineNo??????YesYesMS Project???????????????ThingsNoYesYesNoNoReminderNoYesYesNoYesOpenProjectYes??????YesYesKanboardNoNoNoYesYes\nNext Steps For now, I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to play with Kanboard and see how well it works for me. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably get some details written up on it in the future, especially if I learn anything interesting about it. There\u0026rsquo;s certainly a lot of plugins, but as of today it does enough of what I want it to do, and I probably need to start working on setting up a build environment for my projects.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2023/07/29/__trashed/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHey everybody!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been working through deciding what project management software to setup for myself personally, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking through several options.

I decided to use the USB-C audio interface connection from the SP404 mk2 to my computer since it is a digital connection and I assume (a bit grossly perhaps) that it should be consistent for us. From here, I spent some time recording test tones, tried to record as loud as I could through the line ins and mic/inst jack without clipping, and then did some comparative analysis through Ableton Live to see how these various recordings compared to normalized audio.\nOverall, it looks like there is a hard -3db limit for recording in. You can compensate for this with normalization, but this headroom appears to be reserved for the FX bus, as you can record the input through the FX and get samples that peak at 0db. Interesting for sure, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have a straightforward way to \u0026lsquo;defeat\u0026rsquo; the -3db limit through an FX chain that doesn\u0026rsquo;t color the sample in some way, or otherwise avoid normalization. Normalize, it\u0026rsquo;s fine, and not going to hurt anybody. That, or record someplace else, and then import the sample through the Application or an SD Card.\nI got some questions, and actually spent possibly way too long on it, but dug a bit into sample length limits. It appears that the limit for samples is 185,506,412 bytes, and not the advertised 16 minutes. This really only matters in so much as you can load a mono sample that is up to 32 minutes. I suspect that this is an important tidbit for DJs who are looking to drop in mixes into their set that are longer than the 16 minute limit, but only just a guess. I am sure that there are uses for ambient folks out there as well, though this is an output only hack. Since the mk2 cannot record in mono only (it always records as stereo, even for mono input), you can only go so far with this. Regardless I hope it helps somebody.\nI measured the impact of the System setting under GAIN for Attenuator, and unless my math is wrong, it looks like it is an easy to calculate -14db drop in audio volume if it is turned on. 99% of the time there is no reason to have this turned on, but I suppose if you have a device with no gain knob, it can get you by. Now it just makes me wish that there was a line in attenuator on the back though so I could get a bit of gain or drop the gain if I wanted to. It is what it is though.\nAs a result of all this tweaking I also added a section about maximizing recording volume into the Sampling Chapter. If you\u0026rsquo;re struggling with quiet samples, check it out and see if it can help you get a bit louder.\nThanks everyone for your support and have a wonderful day!\nneartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.28-1 Download\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2023/07/15/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-28/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJust a few simple tweaks for today based on some information I learned while running a few experiments (and answering questions) on my live stream at \u003ca href=\"https://youtube.com/live/LT8YEWt7zuY?feature=share\"\u003ehttps://youtube.com/live/LT8YEWt7zuY?feature=share\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe plan was to figure out a few volume maximums/limits, especially for recording.

This post will probably straddle the line between practical advice and philosophical discussion. If that\u0026rsquo;s not your cup of tea that\u0026rsquo;s okay. There are definitely plenty of resources out there, and I wish you well in finding what you are looking for!\nWithout further ado though, let\u0026rsquo;s get into this.\nBackground Plenty of people in the past have told me I have \u0026ldquo;the gift of gab\u0026rdquo;. I am fully capable of talking too much, and when I feel like it I don\u0026rsquo;t mind being theatrical. This theatrical bent usually leans towards comedy, and I\u0026rsquo;m the type of person who tends to try and find the humor, even if it is very dark humor, in just about every situation. Over the decades I have learned to listen more, and better appreciate the people, places, and things around me, which honestly, better helps me understand who I am and how I may fit within the world.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent a lot of my life concerned about what people thought of me or what I had to say, and this has led me to getting a pretty good filter between my brain and my mouth. I also have figured that anything worth doing ought to be memorable, so if I\u0026rsquo;m going to be worried about making mistakes, at least do it spectacularly. As a result, throughout grade school and college, many of my classmates were in general, terrified of doing presentations after me. I would practice in my head and out loud what I wanted to say, until it felt natural, and I was confident that I could leave a lasting impression.\nThere is also a big part of me that enjoys learning things, literally just about anything, I have too many hobbies/interests and not enough free time\u0026hellip; it is a problem. That said, the challenge of taking something complicated, obtuse, or otherwise difficult to understand, and teaching it to somebody makes my day. I\u0026rsquo;ve never really been looking for money, accolades, or anything else\u0026hellip; just knowing that I can put something of value out into the universe is kind of enough by itself.\nBefore YouTube existed, I was actually doing a video art tutorial series that I called \u0026ldquo;Painting In Five\u0026rdquo; that I was teaching different techniques and processes for how to do sketches, paintings, and all that, that I was posting for free. It was actually pretty popular, but at the time I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in a really good space to make ends meet, didn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of free time, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a way to monetize any of the work or turn it into a business. My dream at the time was to get into creative media, but that\u0026rsquo;s not the career that I had chosen, and when YouTube became a thing, I really thought about posting the videos \u0026ldquo;just to see\u0026rdquo; what might happen with them, but the video encoding became a problem, and I just kind of gave up.\nA lot of things happened since then. I\u0026rsquo;ve been through a *lot* of different jobs and positions, I got married and had a child (well still have, but she\u0026rsquo;s a teenager now), I went back to school to get my MBA and passed with a 4.0 GPA, and since the pandemic I\u0026rsquo;ve slowly been getting free time back. Completing the MBA freed up a lot of time, which pretty quickly was consumed by reconnecting with my wife and daughter. My daughter, as a teenager, mostly just needs me to drive her around and isn\u0026rsquo;t quite as keen to hang out (though I do cherish the times that she actually wants to hang out, play a board game, work on a puzzle, watch tv, play video games, etc\u0026hellip;). Lastly, I\u0026rsquo;ve moved out of super high stress jobs (for now), where I had been on call, managing lots of people, and all around having to be \u0026ldquo;plugged in\u0026rdquo;. As you can imagine, life has continued to change for me, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking for ways to fill some of this new free time.\nSo how did I get here\u0026hellip; well it just felt like something I could do. Also, the advent of the synthfluencer has really irked me. There are folks out there who are working hard and providing excellent information, but (I know this is reductive) a lot of what I see tends to fall into one of two camps. The first camp is \u0026ldquo;hey check out this new gear\u0026rdquo; and just seems to be looking to score as the \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo; for early searches and impressions. Sure, I get it, but I also feel like I can form my own opinions about gear. The second camp is \u0026ldquo;come buy my masterclass\u0026rdquo;, but they don\u0026rsquo;t really feel like they care that much about the gear either, and just kind of \u0026ldquo;go through the manual\u0026rdquo;. It leads to a lot of \u0026ldquo;what does this device do\u0026rdquo; (which, I can figure this out on my own) and not \u0026ldquo;why or how would you use this device\u0026rdquo; (which, actually takes work, time and discipline).\nWhich leads me to why did I do any of this in the first place. Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t particularly want to be an influencer of any kind. I mean, I know it happens naturally to some extent by putting yourself out there. I\u0026rsquo;ve got (some) brands asking me to showcase their products, and sure\u0026hellip; why not, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the point of why I got into this. I\u0026rsquo;d rather be an educator and show people that they can actually use this gear. Purchasing it is the easy part, but it takes time and dedication to get good. Just like my old art videos though, I wanted to show that there are easy, foundational steps, and if you just do a little bit at a time you *will* get there. Nothing magical about it really, and it\u0026rsquo;s also why (to the chagrin of some of my viewers) I leave many of the mistakes in my videos, because it is *okay* to make mistakes. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and we all make them. A true artist knows that a part of their product is founded on the basis of their mistakes, and having the foresight to know when to accept the mistake, and when to remove it.\nObjectives So, I already wrote an essay just on background and how I got here, but it should help to now give some explanation of where I am going. What follows is just a list of mental checkmarks for me, in no particular order or priority, that I\u0026rsquo;ll break down further.\nCreate a consistent and sustainable process to create content I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing often. To that end, I figured that doing a video series would teach me a lot about how to do it. From what specific gear I needed to what software and tools would help, as well as just coming up with a process to actually do all of these things.\nEven though it wasn\u0026rsquo;t where I wanted to start, I kicked off the series using my iPhone to capture video and the Zoom H6 for the audio. It mostly worked, though it had some flaws. In particular I wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with just how I had to set everything up, it was an awkward mess of cables, the order everything had to be turned on was critical to getting the right audio track. It was a good start, but felt kind of fiddly. I think I ran with this setup for 3 months, and kept notes of what I wanted to say, as well as what order to start/stop everything to avoid problems. Honestly the biggest problem here was probably the Zoom H6 because at about -6db on the meters it would start clipping audio, which\u0026hellip; is\u0026hellip; frustrating, and led to a lot of quiet videos.\nI forget the order of things, but around this time I moved over to the Shure SM7B with some rack effects (tube/gate/compressor/exciter) and to the GoPro 10. I used this setup for about a year\u0026hellip; so pretty good longevity\u0026hellip; though not great.\nThe Zoom H6 microphone/clipping was definitely driving me nuts, and I wanted to get a better output. I know I tried using the Zoom H6 with the Shure SM7B, but continued to have clipping problems. Similarly, I was thinking I wanted to upgrade to 4k recording I would get the GoPro 10 and the media kit. The nice thing about the GoPro 10 with the media kit is that you can plug a line in from a mixer, and it will sync the audio to the recorded video. It works well enough most of the time, but sometimes the GoPro just decides to pick up from its\u0026rsquo; own microphone, which leads to bunged up videos that you can only hear me talking and no audio from the SP404 mk2 (or whatever other device I\u0026rsquo;m using).\nLately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying out OBS and webcams. I may try and setup the GoPro 10 as a webcam source, but I ended up picking up a Logitech Brio and an Elgato Stream Deck so that I can have a setup across the room, and then just push a button to start/stop recording on the Stream Deck. This actually saves me time from having to copy files off of the GoPro to the computer, and then upload\u0026hellip; instead when I\u0026rsquo;m done recording session files in OBS I just upload them straight to YouTube. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to get another year or two out of this setup/process at least\u0026hellip; though I suspect what is likely to change the most (such as camera positions/shots) will be additive to this setup instead of a full on change of everything.\nEmbrace Change As you can see from above, I\u0026rsquo;ve changed the setup several times over the course of the SP404 mk2 In Five video series. I suspected from the start that I would likely end up with an OBS setup, as it gives a lot of power and flexibility, but early on, while I was trying to just get started, OBS felt like a hurdle I wasn\u0026rsquo;t ready to cross. It was going to be a lot of investment of time to learn how to setup and position cameras, route audio properly, and then setup all kinds of scenes in OBS. Honestly, if I had started with OBS I\u0026rsquo;d give myself a 50/50 chance of having made it to where I am today because either it would have worked, or I just would have gotten frustrated and moved on.\nStarting simple with what I had on hand allowed me to leverage what I knew, and gave me a clear path of how to grow in unforeseen ways. When I started the video series, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d do 90 or so and be done, but since a bit of an audience has grown with me, I\u0026rsquo;ve also been able to get some guidance and suggestions from people out there in things to try and directions to go.\nInvest no more than five minutes of my time per recording minute After I had finished up my Painting In Five series, and YouTube had been out for a while, I had heard it said that the average minute of finished video took at least sixty minutes to work on before it was posted. My Painting In Five series had been pretty successful, and it was mostly me just recording live, no video processing, maybe doing a few retakes, and then just loading the videos up to a server. It\u0026rsquo;d say on average I was investing three minutes per \u0026ldquo;finished video minute\u0026rdquo;.\nCould I polish up my videos more? Certainly\u0026hellip; there\u0026rsquo;s all kinds of room for improvement. I\u0026rsquo;ve got lighting issues, I\u0026rsquo;m adjusting the SP404 mk2 output by ear, trying to remember to speak loud enough and consistently enough. While I do retakes from time to time, I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s about one or two videos out of ten that require a retake, and frequently it will be one part of a video that I struggle with that takes two or three retakes to get it \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo;. Correct for me doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean perfect, just that I\u0026rsquo;m not leading the viewer down really incorrect processes and workflows, or making blatantly incorrect statements (though this does happen from time to time). All this stuff, though it adds polish to the videos, also isn\u0026rsquo;t really what I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m about. If somebody reached out and said \u0026ldquo;Hey, do you want to work together on making some high quality videos\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;d certainly consider it, but I just don\u0026rsquo;t know that it fits the direction I\u0026rsquo;m going. Plus I would also be concerned that with investing that kind of time there would be heightened pressure to get views, make money, and probably take the fun out of it.\nAt any rate, this has lead me down the path I am at, where I am really focussed on trying to do about five to ten minute videos daily, or around thirty to sixty minutes of content a week. I\u0026rsquo;d say on average I\u0026rsquo;m investing about two to four hours of time a week to this project, so it is pretty easy to slip in recordings once or twice a week around breakfast or lunch time.\nKeep focus on the content, and answer not only the what\u0026rsquo;s, but also they why\u0026rsquo;s Where I feel a lot of educational content falters is that it gets the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; down, and that is easy enough to edit for and make sure it is correct. Yet I think most people value the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; and the flow of it. When learning something new, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get lost in all of the \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; information that may or may not be useful to you at that point in time, but for me at least I always feel like I understand things more when I can understand the \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo;.\nIt is super easy to get lost in the what am I doing, and not why am I doing it. I try to remind myself in my videos to make sure I am calling out what buttons I am pressing or knobs I am turning, and explain why I am doing it. Saying I am going to chop mode is fine, but explaining why I am in chop mode and why am I going for specific settings I am hoping explains to the viewer why they may want to do the same thing.\nThis might also explain to some extent why I am trying to break the videos down into five or so minute chunks, in a larger context of a session. There is the core \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; of what I am trying to accomplish in any particular video such as chop up a loop to make a new sound, create a pattern to build up towards a song, or make a song so that I have something to share with friends. Any individual part of the session should mostly stand on its own to teach somebody a component, and if they understand why I am breaking things down to sessions they can then view how that single component may manifest itself into a broader set of actions or processes that they may also want to take.\nI\u0026rsquo;d say finally, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably where I\u0026rsquo;ll just end this part of the topic for now, is that I also think it is easy for people to see what somebody else did over the course of an hour or two hour long video, and just get lost and figure they don\u0026rsquo;t have the skills to do something. Most things really aren\u0026rsquo;t that hard to learn, but it requires taking an approach to break them down. With the five minute videos I\u0026rsquo;m trying to show anybody who wants to listen that they can, with a little bit of guidance, start from nothing, to having something that they can work into a song in thirty minutes or so. My gut tells me that anybody who wants to follow along, and just take a few minutes a day, even if it takes them a week, can still get to an outcome that I can.\nDo the most good by providing the content to people for free For me, I just feel strongly that as much information that can be provided for free should be made free. I know I am giving people some access to my life, and time, and not charging for it, but not everything in life needs a dollar sign in front of it. I\u0026rsquo;m mostly along for the ride here, and it\u0026rsquo;s been nice to see people appreciate the work that I am doing.\nIf people want to donate for the work I have already done, I\u0026rsquo;m happy for it. I also put right in the guide for people to pay it forward and write me about what they did. Nobody has done this yet, over the year and a half that the guide has been out there, I just have to hope that I have influenced somebody to pay it forward, but who knows. Beyond that, the guide has maybe made $40 or so in donations, and with YouTube ad revenue I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen any income yet. I\u0026rsquo;m not listing any of this here to shake anybody down or ask for money, just to let folks know that as they read this\u0026hellip; you better be getting something out of it than an expectation for a financial gain. For me, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a lot of experience, I\u0026rsquo;ve made some new acquaintances and friends, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned more about the SP404 mk2 than I ever thought I would, and hey\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve mostly had fun doing it too.\nI could get bummed about all of this, look at the investment of time to income, and just throw in the towel, but I can see that what I\u0026rsquo;m putting out there is having some kind of impact. I get the occasional \u0026ldquo;thank you for this\u0026rdquo; comment/email, people reach out in various ways to ask for help, I\u0026rsquo;ve had fun conversations in Discord, and I have just been taking it all in.\nFully own your own content and do not hedge on the future To start, and this fits in with keeping the content free\u0026hellip; I know if I start charging for content, or do it in the wrong way, that I will become beholden to something outside of what I am trying to create. It might sound weird, but the freedom for me is that I can just end this project at any time, or pivot to go do something else, and I will feel okay with it. I\u0026rsquo;m not providing some kind of service for people to get access to my time, instead I am (for the most part) giving access to my time for free. An argument could be made about monetizing the YouTube videos to include ads\u0026hellip; but I\u0026rsquo;m just trying things out, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping they aren\u0026rsquo;t too intrusive.\nThis one I have to check myself from time to time, but I\u0026rsquo;ve also considered experimenting with content a bit\u0026hellip; and have taken some feedback from people who are following my content. To start, I don\u0026rsquo;t have any problem with people making money or charging for their time. I have a job, and I\u0026rsquo;m certainly not giving my work time away for free. On the flip side though, I do have the luxury that I have a job I can lean on, and enough financial freedom to do something like this for free, and buy new hardware as and when I need to without needing to ask viewers or readers to donate. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;m not paywalling anything, and honestly I think that just goes with my brand as it were, while I develop it. I just want to make it clear, I have no problem with anybody making money off of their content, but I do feel like the expectation of quality from the consumer needs to be met as much as possible.\nAnd guess what that means for me, by not charging for content, I get to have the luxury to take my time to put content out there. I have thought about charging for videos, sample sets, books, or other things, but then I also need to consider that (for me) I would then be beholden to those people who pay for those things, and be on a consistent timeline to deliver content. I suppose it comes down to, do I want this to be a job, or do I want this to be a hobby. I have the luxury to just keep it as a hobby, where I sometimes put deadlines in place for myself, while others who do this kind of work for a living do not have that luxury.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t waste time asking for likes, subscribes, money or donations Perhaps my thinking is flawed, or because of how I am approaching this it leads me to not caring, but I am *so* sick of every video or post I see having a \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t forget to hit like and subscribe because it helps\u0026rdquo;. Partly from other people doing that I guess it should be ingrained in the culture now, but I also don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I need to peddle for likes and subscribes, or whatever. If people want something from me, they know how to get ahold of me. Every video has a donation link and the like and subscribe buttons are already there.\nThe videos are intended to be five minutes long on average, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave much time for the intro and outro already\u0026hellip; Could I grow a larger audience by asking? I guess, but I also don\u0026rsquo;t depend on an audience to pay the bills, so another luxury for me. Beyond that, I feel like I have roughly the amount of audience engagement that I can support for doing this for free. I get about 3-10 YouTube/emails/discord messages a day, and most people are quite patient to get a response. Much more than that, and I\u0026rsquo;d probably need to consider asking for volunteers to help, or staffing to get people involved, which\u0026hellip; I make no meaningful income from any of this work. At the very least, it\u0026rsquo;s a problem I can push off for future me to worry about :D\nVideo Recording Process Well if you\u0026rsquo;ve made it this far, you should get a golden star. I\u0026rsquo;m just going to go over what I am doing today, instead of trying to go over everything I used to do.\nSetup My current setup is a Mac Mini M2 Pro, that is running OBS. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a single USB 3.0 cable and an ethernet cable running to the other side of my room that actually has all of my recording gear. This allows me to create scenes for doing things like the handful of \u0026ldquo;Office Hour\u0026rdquo; streams I\u0026rsquo;ve done where I have shared a screen, have my camera pointed at myself, and sometime switch to a \u0026ldquo;SP404 mk2\u0026rdquo; view.\nThe main thing that makes a lot of this work is that I\u0026rsquo;ve got a powered USB 3.0 hub that I can plug all of the USB based gear into over on my music desk.\nOn the music desk side, I have my microphones connected up through the Behringer Tube/Gate/Expander/\u0026hellip; This goes into a mixer, along with any other audio gear such as the MPC or SP404 mk2 that I want to be connected into the mixer. This mixer then connects to my Teenage Engineering TX-6 which goes into the USB 3.0 cable line to provide audio back to the Mac Mini.\nFurther, I\u0026rsquo;ve also got a Logitech Brio setup on my music desk, that is connected to a stand to hold it in position, and again, this is plugged into the USB 3.0 hub to get back to the PC.\nLastly, the Elgato Stream Deck is what I have hooked up to the USB 3.0 hub that allows me to control my PC through a simple interface. I can use it to quickly mute a mic, start and stop recording, and a bunch of other handy stuff. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably get one for my computer desk as well, but for now one is enough just to experiment with and learn what it can and cannot do.\nPreparation To make sure everything is working, I\u0026rsquo;ll turn the main power on for the music desk, then start switching on gear like the TX-6, instruments, and such. With that done, I\u0026rsquo;ll load up OBS and do a mic/mixer check to make sure that I can get my voice and instrument recording.\nThen it is adjusting the camera to be in shot, and putting the microphone where I can speak into it without too much hassle, and trying to keep it out of the shot. Both my microphone and camera arms could really stand to be longer, but on the flip side I probably should consider doing some wood working to make some stands that put them more central to my setup\u0026hellip; some day.\nYou might think that I go into this with notes and no exactly what I am doing. Sometimes I do have notes, for example when I ran through the 3.0 update I referenced the release notes, and had to dig into the manual a few times to understand what they were trying to communicate, but more often than not, I just start with an idea, such as a type of music to make, maybe do a little research, and then just dive in.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll typically do a very short 30 second practice recording, and then play it on my computer, just to spot check that I can hear my voice, the instrument, and that there isn\u0026rsquo;t too much background noise getting picked up. From there, it\u0026rsquo;s off to the races and recording content.\nRecording It could be as simple as saying \u0026ldquo;I press record on the stream deck\u0026rdquo; and go\u0026hellip; and often this is what happens and I just upload the video. Other times I\u0026rsquo;ll make a key mistake, or forget a button combination, and instead of spending a few minutes trying to figure it out and work my way through it, I\u0026rsquo;ll usually just stop the recording, delete it and start recording over again. As I said earlier, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen to regularly, and while practicing making the videos and having a script in the first place might help, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been the style I\u0026rsquo;ve settled into.\nWith the Elgato Stream Deck, I can start recording when I am reading to start at the intro, and I can stop the recording when I am reading to stop at the outro. This works pretty well, because it leaves me without needing to do a lot of post processing and editing. Should I care to, or should I figure out how to streamline some of the other steps, perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ll decide to in the future, but as it stands, I get as output a single file with the video and a stereo audio track that are in time with each other in a single take. Obviously recording everything separately for video, mic track, and instrument track (and possibly more) would give me more flexibility to edit, but since I am trying to keep my process concise, this is kind of it for me.\nUploading Content There isn\u0026rsquo;t much here to think about, I\u0026rsquo;ll just select the files I recorded and upload them to YouTube. I\u0026rsquo;ve considered getting a paid Twitter account to upload the videos to as well, or look at other places to upload, but it would add more time, and expense to my setup.\nThe biggest part here, is just tagging everything and adding descriptions. I am certain that there is a science here, but I\u0026rsquo;ve tried a few ways to get at this, and if I wait too long to tag them I can easily forget what the heck I actually covered in a video. I used to write down in a notebook what each session video was, but I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of stopped doing that. Bad habit on my part, and I should probably get back to it so that I can add better description details to my videos.\nUpdating Videos So\u0026hellip; YouTube editing seems to be sufficient, but not great for editing content. You can remove things, but there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a great way to overwrite. Usually when I\u0026rsquo;ve had a bad video (ie, no music audio), I\u0026rsquo;ll get a comment about it, and I\u0026rsquo;ll go back and remove the messed up video and try and re-record. Sometimes though I\u0026rsquo;ve recorded 2-4 weeks out in advance, and this becomes a hassle to try and rewatch the video, see what I was doing, and then go try and recreate the environment. In those cases I\u0026rsquo;ve often just deleted the entire session and started with the concept from scratch and gone back to it.\nStreaming With the current OBS setup, I have been able to get into streaming. I\u0026rsquo;ve had fun a few times doing it, especially when people hopped on to say hi and ask questions and I could show them things, but honestly, I think most of them have been boring. I\u0026rsquo;d probably need a broader audience to make this work, and I\u0026rsquo;d actually need to take some time to figure out how best to engage with viewers.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible, but will certainly take more effort on my part to make it work. Also, this is probably where I\u0026rsquo;d need to figure out how I wanted to monetize it the most, because honestly it is giving people the most direct access to my time\u0026hellip; overall I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how I feel about it. Wait and see?\nNext Steps Well, I am trying to figure out what I want to do to continue\nMore SP404 mk2 videos, though I am looking at ways to mature them from \u0026ldquo;just the mk2\u0026rdquo; to get into other topics Other instruments\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve done some OP-1, MPC, Force, and other videos and they did okay\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll have to decide if I want to pick up another instrument for a long time like the mk2 or not Go back to artistic videos\u0026hellip; I really did have fun doing the Painting In Five videos, and could see myself going back to that.

I got my first donation of $5 over at buymeacoffee.com, super cool, and big thanks. I know I keep telling you all it\u0026rsquo;s not necessary (it isn\u0026rsquo;t), and I keep doing all of this work for free, but I also want to say it is greatly appreciated. It\u0026rsquo;s going into my future gear purchase fund when I find the next device I want to dig into. I suspect I know what it will be, but well, let\u0026rsquo;s wait and see.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also just hit the ability to monetize on YouTube (yeah\u0026hellip; or boooo), and I\u0026rsquo;ve just been playing with a few of the new videos to see about the hopefully minor popup advertisements. I\u0026rsquo;m really trying to keep these videos short and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to put people through an endless stream of advertisements. Besides, so far, I\u0026rsquo;ve only managed to make $0.27, so it\u0026rsquo;s not like the income would have any impact on my life, and I\u0026rsquo;m not suddenly able to make a career out of informational videos. Either way though, feel free to reach out to me if you\u0026rsquo;ve got any opinions on the advertisement stuff, I\u0026rsquo;d like to hear all of your thoughts out there.\nI donated all of my old AM/FM radio gear, cassette tapes, 8 track tapes, players, and all that. I needed some space back and boy was that stuff all taking up a lot of room. Anyways, sent it off for a good cause and hopefully it will help get some money back into the local community.\nWhat else? I\u0026rsquo;ve been toying with a few logo ideas, and I figured I\u0026rsquo;d try out a test run on this version of the guide. I know, it\u0026rsquo;s not the SP404 mk2 that we\u0026rsquo;ve all come to know and love, but that\u0026rsquo;s Roland branding, and I wanted to try something different out. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a few color versions I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing with as well, if something really sits well with me maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll try and get some merchandise together for a T-Shirt or something\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know yet. For now, or maybe permanently, the guide will stick to black and white\u0026hellip; and the logo seems to work alright.\nAs for the guide updates, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much at the moment a \u0026ldquo;fix it up\u0026rdquo; kind of release. I tried to kill some more of the ??? stuff that I had left in there, and I took notes on sections I actually need to get back to for answering, because there\u0026rsquo;s a fair amount I had stubbed out, and never got around to adding still.\nThen, there\u0026rsquo;s all the YouTube videos. I\u0026rsquo;m on the fence if I should document them in the guide, leave the guide and videos separate, or start drawing the two together. Where my head is at is that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of interesting workflows that I\u0026rsquo;ve documented in the videos that would make a lot of sense in the guide, and there\u0026rsquo;s plenty in the guide that I could do videos on. Typing that up though, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I want them that tightly fused together or not. I\u0026rsquo;ll think on it some more.\nAnyways, thanks everybody for your support, it\u0026rsquo;s greatly appreciated whether it is dropping by discord to say hi, commenting on videos, emailing me, or dropping a few bucks as a donation, it\u0026rsquo;s all good to me.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2023/01/05/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-25/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo\u0026hellip; a lot has happened over the last four(?!) months, for me personally\u0026hellip; not so much the mk2 guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.25.pdf\"\u003eneartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.25\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.25.pdf\"\u003eDownload\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s see, where to start?

The vacation was with my family, we drove about 1200 or so miles to get down to North Carolina, and I had a lot of fun at both the Ocean Isles Beach, and then we spent a day in South Carolina at Myrtle Beach. I did bring the mk2 with me, and was able to spend the first day with my nephew showing him a bit about the mk2, but he is more interested in his iPad and using Garage Band at this time. We had fun, but beyond that I hardly touched the mk2. Not for lack of trying, but it was a lot of driving, keeping friends and family entertained, cooking, and at the end of the day just being tired. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping I\u0026rsquo;ll get some more time in July with the mk2 on my trip to Brazil with my family\u0026hellip; *fingers crossed*.\nHonestly I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been sure what to do next with the guide. I\u0026rsquo;ve had a few ideas, but nothing that felt like it was worthwhile enough to sit down by itself for. Somebody posted on discord a few days ago about the lack of a good Shortcuts guide, and that gave me the idea to just write up a few pages for how it would make more sense to organize to me. What I have so far isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, but you can at least see shortcuts for Sample Mode, Pattern Mode, DJ Mode, Effects, and Settings. There were a few things in there that I realized I missed as well, so it will be a good exercise to keep adding to the shortcuts (or just a straight up commands) section, but also to drive that information back into the rest of the guide as well.\nI also had been sitting on a few notes I had written down from people reaching out to me for other things, so you might see your name as a shout out in the guide if you happened to look around. Above that, I decided it was also time to just start scrubbing through all the ???s I had left around. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot more about the mk2 over the last several months from when I started, and figured it was time to start answering questions for real. That brought me down from about 120 ??? to 71 ??? I believe was the last count. Some of them will take some legitimate time to setup and run experiments, but a lot of it I believe is still worth digging into.\nThe last, rather minor detail, is I decided I am going to start replacing some of the image content with vector graphics. Do I technically need to save space on the file? Not really, but I also have been seeing the file size continue to grow rather rapidly into something that I could see getting a bit out of control. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably just keep designing little symbols for a bit to get the file size back under control, and then I can save the images for things that actually deserve more detail, or aren\u0026rsquo;t just copy/pasted throughout the document.\nI suppose all of this is a long way to say, I am still around, I am still taking input from the community, and I do still want to get folks the best information possible.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2022/05/13/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-23/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA request came in to add a shortcut section, so I added an Appendix G and tried to organize it in a way that made more sense to me than what information is in the official manual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.23.pdf\"\u003eNearTao\u0026rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.23\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.23.pdf\"\u003eDownload\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf anybody has been wondering where the updates have been for the guide, well I\u0026rsquo;ve partly been lazy, I have been trying to figure out how to improve the YouTube videos for the mk2, and well I went on vacation.

No big deal, but just kind of hit this funk. The \u0026ldquo;I am tired of being home all the time and never really seeing anybody\u0026rdquo; head space. Ended up taking a long weekend with my wife in Burlington VT while my parent\u0026rsquo;s watched our daughter and two dogs.

Polyphony is a good example, and something like the MPC 500 had 32 note polyphony, but this was monophonic. The mk2 states that it has 32 note polyphony, but this is by voice.

In pattern mode edit, you cannot adjust the start position of the pattern, only the end position. Exported samples do not contain the project they were from, just named “\u0026lt;bank 1-10\u0026gt; Sample”. The bank should be a-j to match naming, it should include the project, and there ought to be a way to name the sample. Exporting samples will overwrite whatever you have on the SD card without warning you that there is already a sample there. Issues\nThe pattern mode gap bug makes it difficult to sample a perfect loop with either resampling, or skip back. The best option I have found is to double the length of the pattern and then resample or use skip back to work on the first half. You cannot record samples while playing a pattern. As soon as you hit REC it wants to record into the pattern regardless of which screen you are in. I have not be able to figure out how to exit pattern record mode without stopping everything, which forces you to hard stop whatever you have playing. When you are in pattern record mode you cannot enable bus FX. EFX are a pain to edit, and require a bit of menu diving, there are only sixteen favorites that you need to menu dive to edit, and bypass. I’m not sure why these aren’t part of the Bus FX to move around/through, but it is annoying. Probably a setting someplace, but every time I resample the sample gets quieter and requires a normalize to bring it back up to level. Once you resample your Bus FX are disabled, would be nice if there were a setting for the new sample to just not be routed through Bus FX instead of disabling the Bus FX. There is no way that I have found to change quantization on a pattern once you have recorded it… you need to rerecord it which is annoying. There is no Redo after undoing a pattern note entry. Chromatic does not work in pattern mode, forcing you to resample or use skip back to record a single note used chromatically. Chromatic mode does not support custom scales, so you’ll need to know which pads are for your scale and which ones not to use. Chromatic mode cannot be customized to play the notes that you want. Start/End does well, but could use a snap to 0. For the moment I have been using Envelope with a attack of 1 and/or release of 1 to hide the pops and clicks as appropriate. Personally think this is a bug, but GATE does not honor a release setting, so you cannot have a gated note have a nice subtle tail. This implementation may be intentional, but I think it is wrong. The controls on the FX are rather inconsistent, which I’m mostly okay with, but a fair number of them do not have Dry/Wet independent controls… so for example, you do not have a Reverb that can have a 100% wet, and 0% dry setting. For Reverb, you just get level to control the amount of reverb, but no way to reduce the level of the dry signal… boo. Concerns\nThe Value knob gets used *a lot*, not sure how long it will last. Hopefully a long time. You only get 10 mute groups per project. I suspect that this will make things a bit more confusing if you are planning on using all of the banks, and don’t take good notes. I’d prefer to see 16 mute groups, as having one per pad bank and a few spare would be super helpful. Just remember to take notes on what is what folks. I’d like to see under record settings for resampling a way to create a perfect loop. You can kind of wing this with pattern mode and just recording a longer sample and then retriggering the resampled sample in the pattern, but I think there’s a great opportunity here for making this a mini looper that doesn’t quite have a workflow it would need to do it. Or I need to think outside of the box more. It would be nice if you could set the velocity for FIXED VELOCITY, instead of it always being max… I know you can use 16 VELOCITY… but then you’re bouncing between samples… so meh. Probably a setting for this already I need to dive into… but I’m finding resampling is always quieter than what I was playing, so I then need to normalize the sample again to get it back to the level that I want. This might be the setting under GAIN Noise Gate (which is -12db for now)… need to experiment. Remain button doesn’t show you any information about the battery when powered… what’s the voltage left, time left, anything? Chop exporting samples to pads… I haven’t figured out to only export the chops that I want yet and ignore whatever else is there that I do not want. It may be able to do this, but it definitely seems fiddly. No way to convert a sample from stereo to mono that I have found. Would be nice to be able to do this. Oddities\nIt is just strange that there are 3 FX that are only present on INPUT SETTINGS. Auto Pitch, Vocoder, and Guitar Amp Sim are only available as INPUT FX Settings. I could definitely see uses for them in the rest of the MFX, and my guess is they will show up there eventually. The online only manual sucks… why is there no freaking PDF? Change my mind. Feature Requests\nAdd in the three INPUT FX into the other MFX… please. Have GATE use the ENVELOPE release setting to trail off the sample if the release is anything other than 0. Would love to have an FX to cancel center channel or only keep center channel. A way to name samples, even if you have to use the VALUE knob would be super handy… I’m old school and don’t mind doing the three letter GTR, PNO, BAS, shorts… and being able to add in note names into the sample would be helpful. Heck… if it even output the assigned sample and BPM value in the name when you exported… *chef’s kiss*.

Attempts"},{"content":"Got mine Wednesday\u0026hellip; been knocking on the pads quite a bit. Never had a 404 (but got the 202 and 303)\u0026hellip; mostly a heavy MPC user\u0026hellip; so my thoughts come at this through mostly an MPC lens, but definitely with appreciation of where the SP line has come from in previous generations.\nOne of the first things I did was hook up my iPad to the mk2 over USB C. I will tell you, this is an amazingly seamless connection that carries audio and midi data like a champ. Some apps you may have to worry about routing, but stuff like Koala Sampler and Korg Module Pro work wonderfully. You can throw audio and samples around so damn fast it\u0026rsquo;ll make your head spin, and is just *chef\u0026rsquo;s kiss* for bouncing effects back and forth. Even better, if you have Audio Bus 3 or AUM, you can access the stereo inputs, or two stereo outputs directly. Heck, you can even route to outputs 1/2/3/4 as mono, and get your iPad four mono track outputs as it honors those outputs correctly. All of this works without going into any special modes, or booting the 404 as a controller or anything else. Seriously a killer feature in my mind.\nOverall I found sampling just as fast and natural on the mk2 as I have on previous SPs, and getting content onto pads is a bit faster than the workflow on the MPC. There\u0026rsquo;s also, as usually plenty of editing you can do for start/end points, pitch/speed options\u0026hellip; and now we\u0026rsquo;ve also got Chop and Envelope. Chop is quite solid and I can see this being a consistent part of my workflow, but I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely sold on envelope. I was really hoping that with GATE on it would honor the envelope release, but instead you just get a hard stop. So Attack/Hold/Release really only effect the sample as the sample would play from start to end\u0026hellip; and GATE off effectively plays the pad as a ONE SHOT, and GATE on effectively plays it as NOTE ON with no release. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping it is a bug or something that Roland will adjust (or maybe is a parameter setting to find), but so far I haven\u0026rsquo;t stumbled upon anything.\nPattern Sequencer is sufficient for knocking out beats, but there is no grid edit. Personally I am comfortable with the DEL and hold a pad method of removing events because I do it frequently on the MPC, but I can certainly see people not enjoying the \u0026ldquo;by ear\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;get good\u0026rdquo; for timing on the mk2. Honestly, this is probably where people will need the most practice if they want to get all in on the SP, but I could be wrong. I\u0026rsquo;ve also found a few bugs in the Pattern Sequencer firmware, such as when adjusting Pattern loop points, Start doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to make any change, while End can be changed. Still, I think trimming and duplicating patterns will lead to some super fast workflows in the future, and I\u0026rsquo;m confident that Roland will suss out some of this early day issues.\nGoing to confirm with Ill here\u0026hellip; the noise floor on this is just so much lower, as to be non existent, especially compared to the 202 and 303. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for that dirtier sound, the Cassette FX seems to have you covered, but I can absolutely give a thumbs up that the mk2 is going to capture your audio without coloring it *until* you want it to with effects. As an FX box the mk2 is also covering a large amount of ground with the 37 FX. I understand that Roland will likely add some more banks, so hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll see another 32 or so added over time, but for what is on offer I think most people will be happy with what is here, and besides subsonic not being represented (at least yet)\u0026hellip; I think it covers a lot of ground from the 303 quite well, and reviews seem to be positive on a lot of the effects with the 404 og/sx/a, but this is not a space I have experience. So cassette, vinyl (303 and 404), and lofi all sounds quite good to me, and cleaner in a generally positive way than the 202/303.\nPitch shifting compared to the 202 is definitely different. Given how the SP-202 creates sounds, and the sample rate that it works at though, I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;re going to recreate the 202 with the mk2. Whether you love the 202 sound or just want to pitch up/down though\u0026hellip; well the pitch goes +/- 12 semitones on the mk2 compared to the 202\u0026rsquo;s -4 semitones and +2 semitones. On the other hand, at least for me, I can see this as a nearly drop in replacement for even the 303\u0026hellip; and heck it might even cover both well enough for me to pull them out in favor of the mk2.\nAlthough I\u0026rsquo;d kind of like a few more options for ordering and editing the 4 bus FX. No joke, 4 is pretty damn sweet. Right now I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of them as 2 mastering FX for doing stuff that I want to be \u0026ldquo;my sound\u0026rdquo; for whatever I run through the mk2\u0026hellip; and still having 2 bus FX for samples to do some special and specific effects. The biggest drive I have is that it\u0026rsquo;s just a hassle to get at and edit the 2 master effects, and they take up a limited number of favorites slots. Something Roland should probably re-implement, but to get it off the ground and running this at least gets the job done.\nStorage\u0026hellip; 16gb is pretty nuts. Sure a lot of us have way more samples\u0026hellip; but just consider this an opportunity to curate and actually stick with the stuff you love or want to work with. Otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re going to end up with tons of junk, just like you\u0026rsquo;ve got on your MPC, computer\u0026hellip; or wherever else you store your sample collection. Max sample time is 16 minutes per pad, and this ought to be more than enough sample time for folks looking to dump tracks to and then go searching for samples and chops. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget, this thing still operates fully functionally when hooked up over USB C\u0026hellip; so you can use your computer, phone, or tablet to shuffle off samples and mess with stuff from there without committing a lot of storage on the SP. Backups work fine\u0026hellip; though if you load your SP up with 16gb of audio, you\u0026rsquo;re only going to be able to backup twice to a 32gb SDHC card. So keep it in mind if you\u0026rsquo;re going to use the mk2 as your workhorse. Also the import/export is \u0026ldquo;fine\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; but I do find it to be a bit clunky overall\u0026hellip; but will try it out a bit more. I suspect for getting samples around, this is where the App will shine, but I tend to be a more standalone kind of person myself. Should check it out though as it might open up some things for me that I\u0026rsquo;m not considering right now.\nVelocity sensitive pads are nice\u0026hellip; though they do take quite a hit to get to full velocity. I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to mess with the settings to see where I land\u0026hellip; so while nice, I\u0026rsquo;d put it as better than an MPC 500 for sensitivity but under the MPC Live for me at the moment. Fixed velocity and 16 velocity are a savior here when you\u0026rsquo;re just struggling\u0026hellip; and a nice feature.\nChromatic mode is nice, but man\u0026hellip; you cannot play them into Pattern mode. Which is a big *booooo* for me. Hopefully another thing that can be added in a future update, but for now, it looks like if you want chromatic, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to use multiple pads with multiple samples, or record your chromatic performance into a new pad as a loop. Something that is the 303/404 way, so I cannot hate on Roland for implementing it this way, but it\u0026rsquo;s just a bummer when this is such a good effect on stuff from Akai MPCs to the Pocket Operator KO-33.\nWhat else? Oh Skip Back is a solid feature. I\u0026rsquo;m on the fence of whether 25 seconds is too much or not enough\u0026hellip; but even just having the mk2 at an end of chain gives you one last chance to grab some kind of \u0026ldquo;holy smokes that was awesome\u0026rdquo; content\u0026hellip; and I suspect it will be a quicker way for recording some types of audio into the SP without having to hunt and peck for a sound over long streams of audio content.\nSize wise, I\u0026rsquo;m figuring it is about 1/3 the size of an Akai MPC Live mk2\u0026hellip; so much more back packable. Being able to be powered over a USB C connection is handy, and battery power is always refreshing, even if it would have been nice for it to have a rechargeable solution built in.\nOverall, I think for the price this is a strong competitor with a lot of other devices in this price range, and it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty easy thing to recommend to others if they are looking for a Swiss army knife of a sampler/fx box/pattern sequencer\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/11/26/the-roland-sp-404-mk2-is-in-initial-thoughts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eGot mine Wednesday\u0026hellip; been knocking on the pads quite a bit.

I spent about 10 minutes trying to get the mix to an \u0026ldquo;okay\u0026rdquo; place, but I feel like the strings are fighting a bit with the bass line, and probably could have used some filter, ducking, or just about anything to help it hold a bit better together.\nThe weakest part is definitely the drums. I just made a two bar sequence, and kind of hacked my way through controlling a filter and some effects while the song played.

So I drew up a rough sketch to see if I could get some notes on what the issue might be and go from there\u0026hellip;\nThe long component with the knobs/buttons on it that is unlabelled is the Behringer RX1602 that I picked up\u0026hellip; I just forgot to label it apparently.\nAt any rate, the issue I think I\u0026rsquo;ve been having has been that while listening through the MPC headphone out jack, everything is fine, there is no distortion, but the Zoom H6 when I listen to the audio piped in through there with the headphones plugged in I\u0026rsquo;m not seeing clipping, but hearing some to tons of distortion.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot of connections in this setup, and there are several changes from Line Level to Euro Level that makes this difficult, and an interesting challenge. The tone of a lot of sounds are changing subtly just going from the Akai MPC as a digital sample, to the Eurorack, through device changes even without an FX, back out of the Eurorack to the RX1602, then through the Boss SP-202 to Boss SP-303 chain, back into the RX1602, out to the MPC Live Inputs, and finally to my Monitors/Zoom H6 output. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot of steps, and a lot of opportunity for clipping or other issues to occur. Plus, sometimes a sound goes in, and when it goes through everything it comes out like garbage. In other words, sometimes it comes out as a great sound, and others not so much.\nNow\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not a sound engineer, I am aware of ohms and differences in ohms being a problem, and some of these things, but I also don\u0026rsquo;t want to make anything up. Is there an impedance problem? Maybe\u0026hellip; but from a \u0026ldquo;I have a problem\u0026rdquo; experience, what I have been accidentally recording has been digital clipping. I looked at the waveforms and was able to see it. I just find it incredibly weird that no matter how loud I have the volume out while the headphones are connected to the MPC that the headphones sound great with no distortion, but as soon as I connect them to the Zoom I hear it once the headphones are over about the 50% mark on the volume set on the MPC. It literally does not matter what the gain on the Zoom H6 is either\u0026hellip; blah.\nAs an experiment, I ended up hooking the MPC headphone jack out to the Zoom H6 Capsule TRS 1/8\u0026quot; inputs. For whatever reason, this allowed me to set the Akai MPC volume knob up to about 75% for output before experiencing distortion on the Zoom H6 recordings. Given this change, I was also able to adjust gain on the Zoom H6 so that my signal was closer to -3db on the meter, which definitely helps make the recordings feel louder without getting distortion and clipping.\nUltimately I don\u0026rsquo;t feel I have really come to understand the issue so much as I have been able to isolate where the issue is so that I can then work backwards on how to manage the issue better. I do feel like the TRS input on the capsule may be a better solution as it seems to have a bit more headroom for whatever reason, but it may also be better for me to hook the 1/4\u0026quot; outputs on the MPC directly to the Zoom H6, and then monitors from the Zoom H6. The reason I am not doing this right now is that I don\u0026rsquo;t always want to have the Zoom turned on with my iPhone hooked up to it, because it just becomes \u0026ldquo;yet another device that needs to be turned on without necessarily adding any value\u0026rdquo; to the setup. On the other hand, the argument can be made that if I am monitoring at the end of chain I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be having these kinds of issues in the first place.\nConclusion: You\u0026rsquo;re probably best off to catch these types of issues of loudness, clipping, etc\u0026hellip; if you just monitor at the end so that you are hearing what the recording device is hearing.

The picture comes from Neural Blender again\u0026hellip; still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it\u0026rsquo;s definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.\nWell\u0026hellip; the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its\u0026rsquo; range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly +4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela\u0026rsquo;s New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.\nThe drums are another component that I just programmed, and then did the usual output from the MPC 5/6 into the Eurorack and sent it through the Sqwak Dirty for the LPF, which I sync\u0026rsquo;d the cutoff to the Total Recall which was running at a different clock speed than what was being used on the Morphagene. Honestly, this just allowed for a longer running pattern so that even though it was all running, the filter cutoff was changing different between the ambient pattern and the drum pattern.\nFinally the bass line, I tried running it through the Eurorack, but the Eurorack was just eating the sound up. I definitely need to dig into this more, and probably just need to do another track with -9db, but I forgot to do this. Instead I just routed the bass straight out of the MPC channels 1/2, which again, leaves me with the problem that I cannot use the WAV Recorder to recording in a pristine sound. It\u0026rsquo;s possible I should disconnect from the Morphagene and go directly into the Befaco ST Mix\u0026hellip; as it seems that doing it this way it is slightly less distorted, but\u0026hellip; well need to explore this more.\nFrom here, all of the MPC 1/2 output is going into the SP 202 (was going to do some overall mix LPF work manually\u0026hellip; but did not) and then into the SP 303 for some Vinyl Sim compressor, noise, and wow/flutter just to give the track a bit more movement on the tail end.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/10/16/beatober2021-16-simple-life/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDecided to keep it simple today\u0026hellip; really simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat all is going on?

I\u0026rsquo;m not super happy with what I kicked out, but at least I gave it the old elbow grease\u0026hellip; because between you and me, the original bass was just not working.\nI definitely put the overall problem into the category of being too precious of a specific component of a song that I worked on, well a few. By themselves they were interesting, but everything else going on in the track wasn\u0026rsquo;t really going to support it. It took a bit of personal acknowledgement that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be, and to either consider using the other components in the future, or just let it go and move on. For the moment I have moved on.\nAs far as changes, I tried to incorporate some more Mimeophon, but on the other hand it\u0026rsquo;s kind of there, but didn\u0026rsquo;t end up getting brought in quite as much as I had planned. I definitely had some earlier takes that used it heavily, but as I gave it different tries, mix levels and such started to change how I was approaching using Mimeophon. So, not so much this time. I also lightened up quite a bit on the Data Bender effects as well, just so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t such a glitch heavy creation this time.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/10/04/beatober2021-jam-04-jimmy-jam/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all gotta struggle\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/6g9KiCwxqs0\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/6g9KiCwxqs0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-jam-04-jimmy-jam\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-jam-04-jimmy-jam\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlright putting this track together was a pain\u0026hellip; I had too many different elements going on, and out of the *nine* recording attempts\u0026hellip; only one was halfway decent.

I actually clipped out most of this, but I figured I\u0026rsquo;d leave some of the early stuff in, because you never know what you might want to go back to. Especially when a lot of the way I\u0026rsquo;m making tracks with the Eurorack are rather ephemeral, so I guess I just \u0026ldquo;always record\u0026rdquo; in case I have a track I want to go back to and try and at least chop and rearrange a little bit, when the context of what I put together.\nSo lessons learned? First, this was pretty fun, and I\u0026rsquo;ll need to think around this a bit more. I basically just created 3 different tracks with different programs, and then used track mute/pad mute to transition through different 2 bar sections. Nothing fancy, but it was pretty fun and a quick way to get something off the ground through the Eurorack filters. What I would definitely change though is that I confused the heck out of myself with how I setup the stereo tracks on the ST Mix, there was no real reason for the order of anything, which made me have to look at the cables a few times and figure out what was going to what.

So as far as I know, there isn’t any way to change the behavior of the SP-202 or anybody that has taken any steps to reverse engineer how it works. That said, it is an area I may come back to in the future to see if there have been any hackers who have done anything interesting to the device.\nPower Adaptor So to start, the most important thing you should know about the power adaptor for the SP-202 is that it is 9v and center negative. It also needs the adaptor to provide at least 300ma in order for it to be properly and fully powered.\nAdditional information AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nMany guitar pedals use 9v and center negative power, so if you have a power adaptor for your guitar pedal, it is quite likely 9v and center negative. Personally I would still check the specifications on the power supply, but chances are that if it provides over 300ma it should work. If you are feeling extra fancy, and have enough power, you may even be able to power guitar pedals and the SP-202 off the same power supply with a splitter that allows you to power multiple 9v devices off of the same power.\nThe SP-303 needs a 9v 1000ma power adaptor, and I have found this to work just fine with the SP-202. So technically if you have a power supply that works for the SP-303, it should work. Again, I’d still check that the power supply is 9v and center negative, but it should work.\nBattery Power You probably already know this, but the SP-202 can run off of 6 AA batteries. The manual says to expect 8 hours of continuous use off of Alkaline batteries. In practice I find I get about 5-8 hours roughly. This should be more than enough time for most people, and if you need more time you can always bring more batteries or look into using an external USB power pack with a USB to 9v center negative power adaptor.\nPersonally I tend to stay off of battery power where possible to avoid ground loop or other issues that can introduce noise into the system, but if you\u0026rsquo;re using the SP-202 battery powered with headphones you should be fine. We\u0026rsquo;ve all got different tolerances or awareness of some of these noises, and some devices may not exhibit this noise, so if you don\u0026rsquo;t notice, hear, or get bothered by it, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it and just have fun!\nSmartMedia The Boss SP-202 uses 5v SmartMedia (SSFDC) cards and from what I have researched they must be either 2MB or 4MB cards, anything larger or smaller will not work. The majority of SmartMedia cards out there are are larger than 4mb, and of the 3.3v variety, so definitely keep an eye out and make sure you know the specifications if you are looking to get a memory card.\nTo insert the card into the SP-202, you will put the contract traces towards the SP-202 and flip the card so that the contact traces are facing down, then gently insert it into the device.\nOf particular note, these cards have been, and continue to be expensive. As of September 2021, they look to be going for around $100 for a 2MB card and $150 for a 4MB card. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of money for something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily provide a ton of value.\nA question that comes up a lot is whether the SmartMedia cards are even worth it for the SP-202. That\u0026rsquo;s something you\u0026rsquo;ll have to answer for yourself, but here are a few notes.\nThe only way to access banks C/D are through SmartMedia Samples played from SmartMedia consume 3 of the 4 available voices Samples played from SmartMedia cannot use the Pitch, Time, or Delay filters Banks C/D are the only way to record 4 minute or longer samples SmartMedia is the only way you can backup samples from internal memory Sourcing Media If you\u0026rsquo;re not up for paying market prices for the 5v SmartMedia, there are a few ways you might be able to find some at a reasonable price. First, you never know what a pawn shop, thrift store, or yard sale might have. If you keep your eyes open you might just find a deal from somebody who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what they have.\nAnother tactic is to look for specific devices that used compatible SmartMedia. There\u0026rsquo;s a nice cheat sheet provided at SP-Forums, that I am typing up from the screenshot provided in the thread. In theory, any device that used the 2MB or 4MB cards should be compatible with the SP-202, so definitely check eBay, Craigslist, or other places for these devices and see if they have SmartMedia cards included with them.\nCompatible Instruments\nRoland Boss SP-202 DR Sample Roland MC-505 Groovebox Roland JX-305 GrooveSynth Roland XP-30 Roland JP-8080 Roland SRV-3030 Roland SRV-3030D Roland VM-7100 Roland VM-7200 Compatible Cameras\nConia Minolta Dimage V Fuji film DS-7 Fuji film DS-8 Fuji DS-5160A Fuji film DX-5 Fuji film DX-7 Fuji film DX-8 Fuji film DX-9 Fuji film MX-700 Apple Quicktake 200 Polaroid PDS-2000.60 Philips ESP60 Philips ESP80 Sega Digio Sega SJ-1 Samsung Digimax 150 Toshiba 007 SmartMedia Care Be very careful about touching the SmartMedia card\u0026rsquo;s contact traces with your fingers. The oil on your fingers can bother interrupt the circuit, and can cause the traces to oxidize and corrode, possibly decreasing the lift of the SmartMedia card.\nIf you are having problems getting the SP-202 to use the SmartMedia card, one thing to try would be to use a q-tip or cotton swab with rubbing alcohol and gently apply it to the SmartMedia contact traces to try and remove any possible debris that may still be on the card. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to let the rubbing alcohol to evaporate before putting it back into the Sp-202. I would be very hesitant about using any chemicals that are much stronger or applying to much pressure because the SmartMedia cards are quite fragile.\nSamples Assuming you have available internal storage or SmartMedia storage for sampling time, and a free slot to sample to on A/B or C/D, the actual process for sampling is pretty quick and straightforward.\nThe SP-202 records samples at 16-bit, and the Sampling Grade is what determines the sample rate. Hi-Fi records at 31.25khz, Standard records at 15.63khz, Lo Fi 1 records at 7.81khz, and Lo Fi 2 records at 3.91khz.\nEven at the Hi-Fi setting the SP-202 is still considered lo fidelity as it does not even reach 44.1khz which is believed to be a minimum sample rate for any modern gear to provide a listening experience that does not create artifacts due to the Nyquist frequency.\nSampling To start sampling, choose your source, and make sure that you have the switch on the front of your SP-202 set to LINE if you want to sample from your line input or MIC if you want to sample from the built in microphone or a microphone plugged into the MIC jack.\nIf you want to sample to A/B make sure you are either of the A or B banks, and if you want to sample to C/D make sure you are either of the C or D banks. From here, press the REC button to put the SP-202 into record mode, which will immediately open up input from your selected source, so just make some noise to hear if it sounds loud enough, and see the pad that it will record to begin to blink. You can use the CONTROL knob to adjust the incoming volume from your input source, and for myself I tend to make sure I barely see the LED below the CONTROL knob blinking to reduce clipping and artifacts, though certainly feel free to crank it up if that\u0026rsquo;s the effect you are going for.\nThe next thing to determine is what Sample Rate you want to record at (Hi-Fi, Standard, Lo Fi 1, or Lo Fi 2), and whether you want to record mono or stereo. Just remember that mono takes up twice as much sample time and for Hi-Fi requires more voices from the SP-202. Once you are satisfied with your selections, press REC again and then start playing your audio to record.\nWhen you are done sampling, press REC to end the sampling session, or if you just let it run it will continue sampling until the unit has run out of memory.\nCongrats, you should now have a sample you can play back!\nNOTE: If you are finding your recordings noisy, one thing to try to reduce your noise floor by playing from your sample source as loud as possible, before using the CONTROL knob to increase the audio of the sample source. This can be a little bit more of an art than science sometimes, but I personally find it better to increase the sound on the source first and then amplify the audio to the desired level where I am recording.\nSampling Time To see how much sample time you have left, just press the REMAIN button, and the BPM window will indicate the length of remaining time available.\nThe numbers listed below are for mono samples, you will want to halve all of the numbers if you intend to record in stereo samples.\nSampling GradeSample RateInternal StorageExternal Storage (2mb)External Storage (4mb)Hi-Fi31.25khz0m 32s2m 14s4m 27sStandard15.63khz1m 05s4m 27s8m 55sLo Fi 17.81khz2m 10s8m 55s17m 51sLo Fi 23.91khz4m 20s17m 51s35m 43sSample Grades and Mono Sampling Time\nResampling The SP-202 does not support resampling, so if you wanted to resampling something onto your SP-202 after applying effects, you are forced to record to an external device (computer, tape recorder, other sampler), and then record it back in. I\u0026rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise for you, but do be aware that this will add more grit to your samples, and whether this is a good thing or a bad thing is certainly up to the user.\nPolyphony The SP-202 supports playing up to 4 voices, but these voices can quickly be used by Hi-Fi grade samples, samples played from SmartMedia, and from using the built in FX.\nIf a pad is pressed that requires more voices that are available then the first sound played will be turned off in order to fill the request of playing a new sound. Using this as a side effect of how voices are allocated, you can somewhat use this as a track mute effect if you plan accordingly.\nInternal MONOInternal StereoExternal MonoExternal StereoSourceNormal Playback12342Reverse Playback24Not AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableTime Stretch3Not AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableDelay3Not AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableNot AvailableFilter 1/2 Hi-Fi344Not Available4Filter 1/2 (standard/LoFi)244Not Available4Ring Mod Hi-Fi344Not Available4Ring Mod (standard/LoFi)244Not Available4Playback/Filters and Polyphony\nSo what does this tell us? If you\u0026rsquo;re going to use filters, you are going to use up your voices very quickly on the SP-202. If it is important to you to have all four voices available to you, then you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to run everything in MONO, off of Internal memory, and not use any filters. On the other hand, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to be playing only one sound at a time, then you may only want to know which modes and filters are available to you based on the chart above.\nMicrophone If you set the SOURCE SELECT switch on the front of the SP-202 to MIC, it will by default use the internal microphone. When you connect an external microphone to the microphone jack in the front of the SP-202, the internal microphone will be disabled and then it will get a signal only from the external microphone.\nThe manual doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much to specify what type(s) of microphones are compatible with the SP-202, and while I find my AKG microphone seems to work fine, I\u0026rsquo;d like to take some time to see if I can find a list of what types of microphones should be expected to work.\nI have also seen some people consider using guitar pedals into the microphone jack, which while interesting in concept, I will have to do some more research before I give this a try.\nMORE RESEARCH REQUIRED.\nSequencing The SP-202 has no onboard sequencer, so you will either need to record loops for content, or use an external sequencer. From all reports, the DR-202 pairs quite nicely with the SP-202, and is certainly worth checking out.\nOther than that, anything that has a midi output jack, and allows you to specify which midi notes are being sent and to which channel should work well. The MPC line is certainly something worth investigating, and of course a computer with most any DAW ought to work properly.\nPage 38 of the user manual has details of which SP-202 pads and banks map to which Midi Notes and Midi Note Numbers.\nFX - Pitch The Pitch effect is probably the most commonly used effect on the SP-202. It definitely has a different characteristic to it than the SP-303 and SP-404. The effect itself alters the pitch of the sample by playing the sample faster or slower, causing a change in pitch to change the BPM and timing of the sample.\nThe maximum range of the Pitch change appears to be -4 semitones when the CONTROL knob is turned fully counter clockwise, and +2 semitones when the CONTROL knob is turned fully clockwise.\nYou can test this for yourself by recording a C note into the SP-202, and then with Pitch on you should see that the note tuning at it\u0026rsquo;s lowest is a G#, and at the highest you should see the tuning is D.\nFX - Time Stretch The Time Stretch effect is used to alter the length of time of the sample playing, without altering its pitch. This is frequently used to take a loop and speed it up or slow it down without altering the pitch so that the sample will stay in tune with other samples that you have recorded.\nTo note, this effect cannot be used on stereo samples, and cannot be used on samples recorded to banks C/D (SmartMedia card), or when reverse playback is used. This is likely a limitation with the number of voices that the SP-202 has.\nFX - Delay Personally I find this effect to be the worst thought out, it is stuck at 50% wet and you have no option for feedback. Worse, it stops the delay when the sample stops playing. I am sure that it is related to conserving voices on the SP-202, but it just makes for a more difficult effect to use, especially compared to the other effects on the SP-202.\nThat said, a few things to try with the Delay:\nTo have the delay play beyond the length of the sample record silence at the end of the sample. Push the up or down buttons to increase or decrease the delay by changing BPM speed. Change the delay knob while playing a sample to get a kind of glitched out effect FX - Filter 1 This is a pretty standard non resonant low pass filter. It does the job, and a lot of people feel it sounds better than the low pass filter on the SP-303 and SP-404. It is definitely useful, but I am currently not convinced that it has any special properties going for it, and will definitely need to do more testing to see if I change my mind.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re recording content in using LoFi 1 or LoFi 2, this is absolutely a solid option for getting high end artifacts under control, and honestly having any low pass filter is a necessity when dealing with noisy content.\nFX - Filter 2 This is a pretty standard resonant low pass filter. While Filter 1 has no resonance, Filter 2 will add a little emphasis right around where the cutoff frequency is set that can give a little bit more shimmer or emphasis to a sample that is playing. I was hoping that the manual would cover how resonant the filter is, but that\u0026rsquo;s not outlined in the manual.\nOne trick that is mentioned and I\u0026rsquo;ll note here, is that you can get a pretty compelling Wah Wah effect from Filter two by rotating the knob manually. Sure, guitar pedals have an LFO to do this for you, but if you wanted to get a different or specific Wah Wah pattern, you might be able to do something here.\nFX - Ring Modulation A ring modulator is an effect that takes a signal, and more or less makes it sound more metallic. This effect cannot be used on stereo samples recorded to banks C/D or when reverse playback is being used.\nHonestly, I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of this effect, but I should give it more of a chance.\nTips Here\u0026rsquo;s a collection of tips I\u0026rsquo;ve found while using the SP-202, digging through SP-Forums, and other places. If I get some more time in the future I might expand on these someplace, but all of these are definitely worth giving a shot if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to try something new on the SP-202 to get the creative juices flowing.\nCreate a breakbeat loop, set delay to the center point and wiggling to create a Questlove’ish pattern ( https://sp-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=2\u0026amp;t=7540) We all know the 202 has a killer low-end filter. Find a sample with an ill and audible bassline. Put it on one pad. Put the same sample on a pad right next to it (using the Mark Button and setting the BPM prior to recording the second sample comes in handy here). Apply the low-end to one of the pads and tweak till the high-end frequencies have been eliminated to your preference and bang! Works like a primitive resampling feature if used correctly. When I turn my 202 on/off it retains the settings which is a quirky feature I appreciate. ( https://sp-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=2\u0026amp;t=5014) I also used to re-sample by recording my effected sample to cassette or mini-disc and throwing it back in the 202. Quite a process but that\u0026rsquo;s how it was done in 1998! ( https://sp-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=2\u0026amp;t=5014) You can engage reverse while a sample is playing to ping ping a sample (same on the 303) if you have a turntable or tape deck with pitch control, you could sample drums pitched up and then use the pitch effect to slow them back down. or filters, or reduced quality record mode might do the trick. Try recording in with different bit depth settings Use Filter 2 to low pass filter and isolate the bass Don Golman method - breaks on hifi and samples on standard Clip method - snare on standard, everything else lofi1, and make sure clipping hard (lots of red led) Press Mark button quickly to make short loops ( https://sp-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=2\u0026amp;t=24039) Fake mute groups (hifi samples, with Filter 1 consume 3 (4?) voices, choking same settings for other samples ( https://sp-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=2\u0026amp;t=26280) Use mark to create weird loops (live?)

Really gorgeous island, and could definitely just hang out at the beach for days.\nTo make vaporwave you usually take some old 80\u0026rsquo;s music, find a loop, time stretch it way down, and then drop a beat on top of it\u0026hellip; maybe some filtering, reverb, or other fx to boot, but the idea is super easy to do.\nFor building my 80\u0026rsquo;s inspired loop, I just put together something that I thought we sound good for an acoustic house style instrumental, something that\u0026rsquo;d run around 120-130 bpm, and settled on 128.13bpm being the sweet spot for me. I then recorded the track out to the SP 202 using LoFi 1, which added some of the digital distortion and metallic ringing sound. From there, I used PITCH on the 202 to drop the pitch down all the way, and definitely dug the sound of it. I added a hint of Lowpass filter on the 202 as well to just take off a bit of that digital LoFi 1 edge, and recorded the loop back into the MPC.\nRecording into the MPC took a few tries though, since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t starting square on the 1 for starting to play, and the 202 was looping so I was trying to be fancy and record a perfect loop, and just gave up on that. Instead I recorded the bass/synth/guitar mix in after starting recording on the 202, and then gave it an extra beat or two to play out before ending the recording. Recording time was definitely an issue, because the 202 is pretty tight for internal storage, which is the *only* way you can adjust pitch on the 202, with internally recorded sounds.\nWith the loop recorded, I went off to Sample Edit in the MPC, and set the start/end for the loop to work correctly over the four bars that I selected, discarded the rest, and then assigned the loop to a pad on Program 1 and named it Vapor.\nAt this point, I just created a second drum kit so that I could have a kick, snare, and a couple of hats that I could keep separate for insert fx from the main core Vapor. I laid out a super basic house style kick hat snare hat pattern, and was off. I did filter the drums down a touch, enough for the hats/snare to have presence, but not so much for them to tear through the mix.\nWith the basic drum pattern out of the way I figured it was time to focus on automation for the Vapor track. I simply put a low pass filter in place, and just adjust it roughly ever 4 bars so that more or less of the high end was coming through. This helped give the track some movement and build up, without having to spend a lot of time figure out drops and such. I did go through a tweak the drums a bit by hand, and honestly if I had exploded the drum track and then recorded track mutes this probably would have been a bit faster, but this seemed to come out pretty well.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/09/05/jamtember2021-track-ride-the-wav/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell today I felt like messing around with making a vaporwave styled song\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother picture courtesy of my trip to Hawaii.

I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to spend a ton of time on sound design here, and really just did some subtle insert effects by and large.\nWhat definitely makes this track different is that I put a Talkbox insert effect on the entire track, which is why I ended up needing the limiter on the end to help get some of the automated dynamic changes under control.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/09/04/jamtember2021-track-way-up/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eExpecting today to be a bit crazy, and I woke up early.

If you already have the suite you should have gotten an email, and he also posted some information on the MPC Forums thread YA MASTERING TEMPLATE.\nBelow is what I just posted in the thread, but adding here for posterity.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a track with and without using the YA Mastering Template 2.0.2. Anything that sounds bad here is frankly on me for not taking a bit more time to adjust and get the sonics under control.\nOriginal Track This is the original track, I mixed drums and bass to -9db and everything else from there, no end of chain effects or anything… it is pretty dry.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/the-last-mile\nMastered Track The same track, I tried the same mixing as above, as well as to -15db (in case it was toasty due to level issues, spoiler it was not), and the mastering chain happened to be accentuating some high end noise… so to get it under control I did some quick filtering as well on each track (LPF around 2k to 8k per track)\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/the-last-mile-yam\nThoughts For this particular track and how noisy the samples were (all samples run through an SP 303 and picked up some distortion/dirt) that I used, I actually expected the mastering chain to require more work than I usually need to put in, and if you listen to the drums they are still a bit toasty. This is for me to fix, not the mastering chain to manage. I am impressed at how well the mastering chain pulls some of the more subtle sounds out, bringing them to the foreground, and it does continue to do a great job in my mind for rounding out the sound.\nApplying the 2.0.2 mastering is just as easy (or difficult depending on your viewpoint) as it was in the past, and I\u0026rsquo;ll probably do some A/B comparisons between the 2.0.1 (which I have to say is A+ already) and 2.0.2 to see if I prefer one over the other. The only difference I really noticed so far was that the limiter seems to be holding the track from mastering to 0db, and instead is targeting -3db. Whether you like this or not is probably up to you… but I guess the only thing I\u0026rsquo;d note is that as a user you can obviously adjust this in the master fx chain to your personal taste… and it means that the YAM track is not quite as loud as it could possibly be.\nAnybody who\u0026rsquo;s interested in putting in the time (even if it is just 15-30 minutes) to improve their mix and take another step towards finishing their sound should definitely check this out.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/08/27/yorgos-arabatzsis-mastering-2-0-2-released/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYorgos just released the 2.0.2 mastering suite for the Akai MPC Live/X/One using some of the new features in the 2.10 firmware.

A box in the corner with some music gear, instruments, effects, or whatever, that we want to use but don\u0026rsquo;t really use. For me, this box was holding an OP-1, OP-Z, Microgranny, Organelle, and plenty of other things. All really fun and cool gear, but I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to use them lately, and just wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting much value or use out of them.\nWith a heavy heart, and feeling a bit guilty for putting money into this gear but not getting much use out of it, I decided it was time to put it up for sale for somebody else to hopefully use.\nTeenage Engineering OP-1 This was something I just wanted for so many years, but the price really is too much. However, I did do a lot of research on it, and at least had a very clear idea of what I would be getting into. I knew it was going to be obtuse, I knew that it didn\u0026rsquo;t support multiple projects, and I also knew it had a lot of interesting restrictions that I felt would help push me into solving musical problems in an interesting way.\nThat said, about a year after having bought it, I dug the looper, and I found the instruments to be decent, but I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t escape the toy feeling of how it worked, especially when comparing it to the MPC Live. Sure, this is not a fair comparison by any stretch of the imagination, but I have made the conscious decision to dig more into the workflow of the MPC Live, and the way the OP-1 works is at direct odds with how I have gotten myself to be more effective and productive. So last year I put the OP-1 up for sale, and then after a few days decided to take it down. I just liked the idea of it so much.\nAfter taking it down, I\u0026rsquo;d use the OP-1 from time to time, especially for just doing some quick sampling or looping, and I have to say it continues to be a fun if restricted looper. I decided to take the OP-1 with me on a nine day vacation, mostly because of it\u0026rsquo;s size, and I planned to make a track a day with it. Just something to really push myself to get into it or get out of it. Well, I did do a track a day with the OP-1, but I have to say I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really excited by it any more. I just felt like it was a lot of fighting with it to get anything done, and the lack of undo features, as well as how easy it is to accidentally ruin a track by overdubbing content on top, I just decided it was time for it to go.\nIt might sound like I don\u0026rsquo;t like the OP-1, and this is absolutely not the case, but I have come to the realization that it\u0026rsquo;s just not adding much to my music production.\nThings I will miss about the OP-1:\nLimited, but quick sampling Although mono, the looping abilities are a treat to work worth, 8 tracks would be so dreamy Odd but inspiring synths, the controls weren\u0026rsquo;t always great, but you could stumble on interesting ideas Committing to tape, this has forced me to consider approaching material in a more direct and less structured \u0026ldquo;on the grid\u0026rdquo; way Teenage Engineering OP-Z I\u0026rsquo;ve quite enjoined the OP-Z and just how immediate it is as well. While I never really found it expressive per se, it was definitely quick, and the sequencer, oh why could the sequencer not have made it in some form to the OP-1? The size of the OP-Z is amazing considering just how much it can do, and while there were plenty of complaints about case bending and knobs popping off, I never had problems with either and bought mine pretty early in the lifecycle.\nThat said, I just never came to love the OP-Z. The parameters for it were always kind of obtuse, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t really memorize all the key combinations. Getting the skin for it was a big help, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t terribly fun for me to be constantly flipping it over to read another key combination to put it into some mode to program parameter locks, adjust track settings, or some other thing. Conceptually I really like the OP-Z, but in the long run I guess the implementation just didn\u0026rsquo;t hold me.\nSo, I also took the OP-Z with me on the trip to Hawaii, just as a last ditch effort to try and do something, anything with it. I absolutely got my head wrapped around it more, but the entire time I was just wishing I had the MPC with me. Hard decision time, but I put the OP-Z up for sale as well.\nThings I will miss about the OP-Z:\nI do dig the parameter lock concept, and while there are things that are similar on the MPC, the OP-Z can currently do a lot of randomization and other things that you just cannot get at right now on the MPC line. Size, if the OP-Z just had a bit more robust sampling time, better sampling, anything, I\u0026rsquo;d probably consider keeping it. I felt like it mostly struck a great balance between size and features, but probably borrowed a bit too much from the OP-1 constraints for my taste Bastl Instruments MicroGranny 2.5 It\u0026rsquo;s an 8-bit granular sampler, what\u0026rsquo;s not to like? I have to say, that it\u0026rsquo;s a clever little device, and it can sound great. The built in microphone makes it another gem for a portable setup, and you can get a lot out of such a weird and wonderful package. Better still, it is battery powered so you can toss it in a bag and play it. The biggest bummer to me is that it is only one note of polyphony, but you can manipulate six different samples, and you can address it from a MIDI controller to do some really fun stuff.\nSadly, I think this just was in the \u0026ldquo;okay lets sell things off\u0026rdquo; rampage. I had a ton of fun using this, especially on some ambient tracks I did, you can hunt and peck for some very awesome sounds, but it\u0026rsquo;s also kind of a long process to load in samples in the right format, audition them, and use the semitone knob to adjust pitches and restart the sample. While the interface is fairly straight forward, I think the operation was just let down a bit by the hardware implementation itself. Still fun, but I guess it was time to move on.\nThings I will miss about the MicroGranny\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just at that weird end of the LoFi spectrum where you\u0026rsquo;re not going to get clean samples no matter what you do, it grinds up and spits out whatever you send its way Again, another device that portability cannot be beat, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find that it ate 9v batteries too quickly. It struck me as a good balance for use of hardware Critter \u0026amp; Guitari Organelle M This wacky device just struck me as the end all be all device. Super backpack friendly, mic, speaker, batteries, keyboard, and unlimited patches. Just something you can go anywhere and do music and have fun. This is 100% true, and I love the company\u0026rsquo;s vision for this device. Then, add on Technobear\u0026rsquo;s updates and everything, holy smokes this device is banging! You can literally make anything on it, and watch the videos Critter \u0026amp; Guitari put out, I mean how can you not love this thing?\nSeriously, even though I sold it, I still love it for what it is. Where I made the decision to sell it off though was more about the interface and how it comes together. Similar to some other things on the list I think ultimately the inconsistent UI let\u0026rsquo;s it down. There are just so many patches, and they all operate incredibly differently. The tiny display doesn\u0026rsquo;t always do a great job of showing you what is going on inside the device, and while you can hook up an HDMI cable and look at the patches, that\u0026rsquo;s not something I suspect most people will do, and I doubt most people are going to print out manuals for each every patch either. It\u0026rsquo;s just overwhelming, and I guess the reality set in and I decided I have more focussed instruments to do the jobs I was interested in using the Organelle M for.\nThings I will miss about the Organelle M:\nJust how programmable this thing is, it can literally become anything you can imagine and put your mind to The fun and wild patches that lead to interesting experimentation The patch community was awesome and really lead to some fun interactions Conclusion I feel like once or twice a year I go through this kind of purging exercise, and then write about it, and I have no idea if it helps anybody else, but it does help me get a better understanding of what I want and what I am trying to do with music and gear in my life. I keep saying I don\u0026rsquo;t want to become a museum, and I really am not. I don\u0026rsquo;t need multiple devices doing the same thing, even if I do have overlap. This has also helped me figure out which kinds of things I have ordered that have been stuck due to \u0026ldquo;chip shortages\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; stuff I probably just don\u0026rsquo;t need so should get the money back.\nThe last few weeks I\u0026rsquo;ve also been spending more time getting focussed on a project with the MPC and a limited set of eurorack gear to put a set of tracks together. The box of shame wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly getting in the way, but it is also a set of gear that I no longer need to consider about maintaining, or feeling bad that it is just \u0026lsquo;sitting around\u0026rsquo; and unused. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be extending this to some gear I am hesitant to get rid of, but I also am feeling more and more that it will be a good exercise for myself to be realistic about how much gear I really need and can realistically use and keep maintained.\nOddly, and I\u0026rsquo;ve kept thinking back on this set of gear in particular, I had picked it all up pre pandemic with the intent of going out and making music on hiking trips, business trips, I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; all kinds of trips. The reality has been, I\u0026rsquo;ve been mostly staying at home and have not taken many trips, and have as a result spent most of my time in my house, like just about everybody else. My vision just never really came into fruition, and I don\u0026rsquo;t see this changing over the next year or two either. Given some of the latest updates for the MPC 2.10 firmware, I\u0026rsquo;m also seeing it come into it\u0026rsquo;s own as an instrument, and while it has plenty of bugs, nothing has made me think that Akai won\u0026rsquo;t keep improving the instrument and the platform. So, I think I could be moving into a world where I just get a decent case for the MPC and when I travel it can come along with me, and otherwise it will stay hooked up to the rest of my studio.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;m feeling quite good about moving on what I have moved on, and I look forward to the next few months seeing which direction I intend to go for myself and my gear.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/08/20/the-musical-box-of-shame/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of us have it.

I\u0026rsquo;ve monitored the gates being sent over CV and have seen that it is not dropping gates, so over time the average will be correct, even if there is a small variance in the BPM at a specific gate trigger.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll go over the setup here and show some pictures, as well as do some math to show roughly what the possible difference is for a note and how far off it might be.\nMPC Setup To setup your MPC to send gates, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty simple. First you\u0026rsquo;ll want to pick a track, and change it to a CV Track type.\nAs you can see above the CV PORT is set to CV 1, and the GATE PORT is set to CV 2. For this particular application I am not going to be sending CV information, I just want a consistent clock gate being sent. So let\u0026rsquo;s change this.\nFor my purposes I have set GATE PORT to CV 1, but you can use any CV you have available to you. The only thing I\u0026rsquo;d say to remember is that you\u0026rsquo;ll need a splitter if you\u0026rsquo;re on the MPC Live mk2 or on the MPC One, otherwise you can only use the CV 1 through CV 4 outputs to interface with your Eurorack. I documented the splitter solution I have using at Akai MPC Live mk2 / One CV outs in case you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a solution.\nWith this setup, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to record some gates. For the MPC the easiest way to do this is to hold down NOTE REPEAT and lay out a single note consistently on your MPC. My process for this is to press Overdub and Play, then hold NOTE REPEAT set to 1/64 and hold down a single pad for the duration of the loop you\u0026rsquo;ve got setup. This will lay down a lot of note data at a consistently repeating timeframe that will function as our gate data for the MPC to send.\nSo what you put together should roughly look like the above. In this case I setup two bars of data, and if I need more then I can either record a longer Sequence, or just go to Sequence and x2 it to double the length. The important thing is that you have notes in place for every part of the sequence playing so that everything stays in time.\nPamela\u0026rsquo;s New Workout Setup So the way that you sync Pamela\u0026rsquo;s to your MPC is going to be through CV clock. One thing to note is that the more gates you send, the more accurate it will be and the faster it can react to a BPM change, but the more signals you send, the more you\u0026rsquo;ll notice hiccups or oddities as they show up. We\u0026rsquo;re talking about very small timeframes though, so it depends how sensitive you are.\nThe first thing you\u0026rsquo;ll need to do is take the CV cable from your MPC and plug it into the Input Clk jack of your Pamela\u0026rsquo;s New Workout.\nAt any rate, if you\u0026rsquo;re on the BPM screen below, just do a long press on the Program knob. This will allow you to edit your settings to adjust your clock rate. Otherwise you ought to be able to rotate the Program knob to get yourself to the BPM page, and then do the long press.\nAfter you open up your settings menu, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to rotate the knob to get to the PPQN setting. This is where you will set how many Parts Per Quarter Note that you will have. With a 1/64 Note Repeat, this means that you have 16 Parts Per Quarter Note. If you decided to record 1/64 Note Repeat with Triplets, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to set your Parts Per Quarter Note to 48. So yes, you can send a wild\nWith this said, you\u0026rsquo;ve should now be in sync. You may need to press the Start/Stop button to get the Pamela\u0026rsquo;s New Workout to start triggering, and then you\u0026rsquo;ll be off and going!\nExperiments Below is some data that I collected by changing the PPQN values on Pam\u0026rsquo;s and adjust the events on the MPC to match. I hooked up the Waldorf Iridium over Midi to watch for BPM variance as best I could and see how that might help correlate to the Pam\u0026rsquo;s Variance.\nBPMPPQNPam\nVarianceIridium\nVariancePam\nStable201600.0Yes251600.1Yes301600.1Yes351600.1Yes381600.1Yes391600.1No901600.2No1001610.2No1201610.3No1901620.5No2501630.7No202400.0Yes252400.1Yes262400.1No302400.1No902400.2No1002400.2No1102410.2No1902410.5No2502420.7No204800.0No904800.2No1004800.2No1204800.3No1904820.5No2504820.7No\nJust looking at the data I can already tell you that it\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious that the tolerance from Pam\u0026rsquo;s is a function of how many events you are producing and how far they are off. This is why we\u0026rsquo;re seeing a PPQN of 16 able to go to a higher BPM of 38 than the lower BPM\u0026rsquo;s from the MPC with a higher PPQN, while maintaining BPM stability. This is roughly what I would expect.\nEven with these BPM fluctuations coming from the MPC, you are still not seeing any displayed BPM fluctuations from Pam\u0026rsquo;s until you break 100 BPM, and 120 BPM if you are using 48 PPQN.\nConclusion Am I bothered by this? Not even a little. I have confirmed that every single gate triggers, so you are not dropping events, which would be a problem. Further, the more events that you send, the faster that Pam\u0026rsquo;s responds to the BPM changes and locks into the BPM.\nAlso, doing the math at 250 BPM, a variance of +/- 2 is less than 1% off (roughly 0.08%) for timing. Human\u0026rsquo;s are typically not even that accurate, especially over long periods of time. I know some people get very particular about their BPMs, and seeing the displays wobble over time, but I am not one of those people. This is certainly close enough for me.\nThat said, I do have a breakout for Pam\u0026rsquo;s, and I will be trying to sync Midi from Pam\u0026rsquo;s to my other devices to also see how stable Pam\u0026rsquo;s is for outputting a clock.

A reason to consider making your bass or kick mono might be if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a cross over to/from your subwoofer, making your low end sounds mono, but beyond that, I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of old school information floating around as the right way to get \u0026ldquo;that sound\u0026rdquo;. So yes, there absolutely are tons of reasons to make your kicks and bass mono, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a good reason to do it \u0026ldquo;just because\u0026rdquo;. Certainly do it if you want to, and better if you have specific reasons for it.\nBelow is my response on MPC Forums, just to help outline some of the reasons that people may go for a mono sound.\nA traditional reason to make Kick/Bass mono is because on most high end concert systems they have a single sub woofer for output or all their woofers are crossed over and summed to mono. If you output a stereo bass you run the risk of phase cancellation, causing you to output either no bass or heavily distorted bass, which is incredibly hard to compensate for.\nA second reason for moving to mono for Bass/Kick is because they tend to take up a lot of headroom for your track, so by making them mono it is much more clear how to mix/master for them, as you have less of a moving target (ie the sound field changing per channel).\nA third reason for moving to mono for Bass/Kick is if you were going to press your audio to a record/vinyl, it is quite possible to cause the needle to hop and skip because the low end could literally throw the needle by vibrating so much. Honestly, with modern record player and needle technology, this really isn\u0026rsquo;t a problem\u0026hellip; but people would still go with mono.\nA fourth reason I\u0026rsquo;ve seen a lot of people mix in mono for any given sound was due to lack of resources (ie CPU or memory), and by switching to mono you can increase your sample time, polyphony, etc\u0026hellip; on older devices. This is not a problem in modern platforms, but for things like bass and really low kicks, you feel it more than you hear it, so making it mono doesn\u0026rsquo;t really impact the \u0026rsquo;listening\u0026rsquo; experience.\nAt any rate, know what you are mixing/mastering for. There are tons of reasons to mix in mono or mix in stereo. This is just me personally\u0026hellip; but I think you\u0026rsquo;re asking the wrong question \u0026ldquo;does it mix better\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; nobody can tell you. What are you comparing it to, what process are you trying to emulate, have you even tried it? Seriously\u0026hellip; use your ears, and do an A/B test yourself and see if it sounds better, not some goofy stuff you\u0026rsquo;ve read somewhere. Music, just like any other art form only really takes value from the producer when they use their own sensibilities to make their own decisions. While I think it\u0026rsquo;s cool that you\u0026rsquo;re thinking about mixing and mastering, and different techniques, none of it is going to give you a magic bullet to make your sound \u0026ldquo;better\u0026rdquo; out of the gate.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/06/03/should-you-make-your-kicks-and-bass-mono/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOver on \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48\u0026amp;t=211301\"\u003eMPC Forums\u003c/a\u003e DokBrown asked about making kicks and bass mono, and the impacts on making a better sounding mix/master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I think for home studio creation, your bass or kick being mono doesn\u0026rsquo;t terribly matter.

There are countless posts of people having problems with their MPC acting weirdly after either filling up their internal drive or removing content that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to be an issue when it is removed. Akai has traditionally not been responsive to getting people access to the restoration files and it does not have redistribution agreements so that even if people on MPC Forums or other places had it, they still are not legally allowed to give it to you.\nWhat is going on to cause issues, I\u0026rsquo;m not aware. I just give this word of advice to keep your sanity and keep your device functioning as smoothly as possible.\nCommunities There are a ton of communities around the MPC. The one I hit up the most is MPC Forums, but reddit has a sub forum r/mpcusers might be worth checking out. Gearspace has an MPC Live thread that continues to be quite active. There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of other stuff to find as well, in fact too much to really point to honestly. Do some friendly internet searches and I am sure you can turn up more content than you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to consume quite quickly.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll update this section as I am able to, maybe some other communities will come to my attention as I maintain this post.\nX vs Live vs Live II vs One I could, but I am not going to knock out a table for a full comparison. By and large the software is the same, but I will note a few key differences.\nMPC X - has 4 inputs, which can be monitored together with your outputs. Not a true 4 input as when you sample you need to pick 1/2 or 3/4, but it\u0026rsquo;s a handy feature. There are 8 discrete CV outputs, so if you\u0026rsquo;re going to use modular gear, it is a nice choice. You\u0026rsquo;ve also got room for in internal drive bay, 16 q-links with OLED real time displays, and just a lot of nice buttons baked into the interface. The 10\u0026quot; tilt display is great too, and between the 16 q-links and larger display is probably the biggest thing I miss about the MPC X.\nMPC Live - the battery is the big selling point here, but the reduction to 4 Q-Links is kind of a bummer. I get it for space constraints, but it\u0026rsquo;s a bummer. Also, there are no CV outputs on the original MPC Live, which is a bummer. Again, it has a bay for an internal drive which is nice. I owned this when it was released, and really liked it, but as I got into modular gear I decided to sell it off. If you can find one for a good price, and the battery is still holding a charge though, I\u0026rsquo;d definitely suggest keeping an eye out.\nMPC One - I have no experience with the MPC One beyond helping a few people who I know have one with some questions. I know it adds CV outputs, it only has two audio outputs (1/2), and if I remember correctly they added an ethernet port to it. I know it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have bluetooth, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support mounting drives to your computer over USB, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Live Control mode, has no internal drive bay, and overall it just sounds like an artificially reduced feature set, which is a real shame. That said, for something to get into the price is great, and you can absolutely find good deals on the MPC One. It is mostly as fully featured as the MPC X and MPC Live product line, and you\u0026rsquo;ll probably get over the differences once you have it in your hands.\nMPC Live II - the biggest changes here are adding an ethernet port, CV outputs and it has a front speaker. Personally, I also find the added buttons and sub buttons (through long press or double tap) to be great. This is the only MPC I have at this time, and I can fly around it quite quickly. Some people see the included speaker as a downgrade, but personally I dig it. It\u0026rsquo;s something that is fairly easy to ignore (unless you are luggage or other space constrained), but when you just want to knock something out or jam with somebody else having it there can really get you to having fun so much faster.\nAnyways, I feel quite comfortable in saying that all of these MPCs frankly hold their own with each other, and the overall minor differences will really come down to how you plan to use the MPC or if there are specific price points or feature sets that you just have to have.\nBlack vs Gold vs Retro As far as I know the colors are only cosmetic changes, so go for whatever you think looks good and is available for you at a reasonable price. I do not believe these differences change access to expansions on the Akai website, and it definitely doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the ports, cpu, memory, storage or anything else outlined throughout this post.\nMPC Bible I will absolutely, highly, emphatically\u0026hellip; suggest checking out (i.e. purchasing) MPC Tutor\u0026rsquo;s excellent The MPC Bible - For the MPC Live, MPC Live II, MPC X \u0026amp; MPC One. This will answer a ton of questions for you, and gives some great exercises to work through if you are unfamiliar with the workflow, or have questions that the Akai MPC Manual doesn\u0026rsquo;t answer. Plus the Bible comes with some samples, so it will help get you off the ground and running.\nEven if you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with your MPC or have read the MPC Bible before, Tutor has done a great job keeping it up to date with the wealth of changes provided by the updates. It is certainly a powerful companion to have by your side!\nManual You can find the manual for Firmware 2.9.0 at the Akai Website. That\u0026rsquo;s the current manual at the time of writing this post. You can also find downloads and links by going to Akai\u0026rsquo;s MPC Series page, selecting the MPC you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, and either clicking on \u0026ldquo;Downloads\u0026rdquo; in the navigation bar or scrolling to the bottom of the page for the section labelled \u0026ldquo;Downloads \u0026amp; Documents\u0026rdquo;.\nI have not come across a service manual for the MPC Live/X/One line yet, but if I become aware of it I will make sure to link it or otherwise reference it someplace.\nFirmware The current firmware right now for this line of MPCs is 2.9.1, and similar to the manual you can find it by going to Akai\u0026rsquo;s MPC Series page, selecting the MPC you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, and either clicking on \u0026ldquo;Downloads\u0026rdquo; in the navigation bar or scrolling to the bottom of the page for the section labelled \u0026ldquo;Downloads \u0026amp; Documents\u0026rdquo;.\nSoftware Similar to the firmware on your MPC, if you\u0026rsquo;re going to use a computer you\u0026rsquo;ll want to be using a compatible version of the software on your computer. The MPC Software\u0026rsquo;s current version is also 2.9.1, matching the firmware version of the MPC. Again, to get the software go to Akai\u0026rsquo;s MPC Series page, selecting the MPC you\u0026rsquo;re interested in, and either clicking on \u0026ldquo;Downloads\u0026rdquo; in the navigation bar or scrolling to the bottom of the page for the section labelled \u0026ldquo;Downloads \u0026amp; Documents\u0026rdquo;.\nOn Windows this is pretty straight forward, so you\u0026rsquo;ll just need to install it. This is a pretty hassle free experience.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re running Mac, I believe that the drivers and software are only supported on Intel, and I\u0026rsquo;m fairly certain that while the drivers and software work on macOS Big Sur, I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that it is technically supported. I suspect that the software will run on an M1 Mac, but I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to bet that the drivers do not work. I do not have an M1 Mac at this time though, so cannot confirm or deny this. The latest article I was able to find on Akai\u0026rsquo;s website about Big Sur is here. So I guess if you are concerned, don\u0026rsquo;t upgrade? Seriously, Mac support from Akai is pretty bad, and makes me sad.\nFor those of you running Linux, you might be able to get the software running in Wine, the biggest problem is likely to be the drivers. My advice if you\u0026rsquo;re running Linux and want to use the MPC Software is to setup a VM with Windows on it, and then let the VM pick up the MPC over USB.\nPower Supply The power supply on all of these devices is 19 volt and 3.24 amps as far as I am aware.\nOn MPC Forums there\u0026rsquo;s been some discussion off and on about battery power for the MPC One, since it is kind of a missing feature from the platform. For those of you interested I would definitely suggest reading the thread [PSA:](THOSE WITH MPC ONE\u0026rsquo;S CONSIDERING AN EXTERNAL BATTERY) THOSE [WITH MPC ONE\u0026rsquo;S CONSIDERING AN EXTERNAL BATTERY](THOSE WITH MPC ONE\u0026rsquo;S CONSIDERING AN EXTERNAL BATTERY). There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of good information, warnings, and suggestions worth checking out.\nI would expect that if you wanted a battery solution for the Live or X that whatever works for the One should also work for those MPCs as well. That said, the Live already has a battery, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how relevant it would be for the X given its size.\nMemory This MPC Line does come with plenty of RAM, assuming you think 2GB of memory is plentiful. The issue seems to be that all sample content loaded is immediately converted to 32-bit, which will consume more of your RAM.\nMPC Tutor did a great write up about this overall, so if you\u0026rsquo;re interested read the Lab Test: How Much Usable Memory is there in the MPC Live \u0026amp; MPC X. TL;DR There is about 53 minutes of sample time available in the MPC.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re not likely to exceed the 53 minutes of sample time without Akai making changes to allow for Disk Streaming or other technology. Just consider this a fact of life for your MPC.\nStorage The MPC Live, X, and One all have an internal storage drive. My advice, do not delete or save any content here. It will lead to problems with the operation of your MPC. Some people have taken it upon themselves to investigate upgrading the internal storage, so if you\u0026rsquo;re interested check out MPC LIVE INTERNAL MEMORY (STORAGE NOT RAM) IS A MICRO SD. You can definitely upgrade from the 16GB internal micro sd card, but it seems like a large hassle because you cannot mount this storage anywhere and it is a pain to get access to in general.\nThe MPC Live, X, and One lines all have access to USB and SD card reader storage, and when you go into controller mode on your MPC these storage devices should show up as mounted on your computer and be accessible for reading and writing. This is a pretty quick way to move content around between your MPC and computer.\nAdditionally, the MPC Live and MPC X lines have room on the bottom compartment for an internal hard drive. My advice is to use an SSD so that you won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about rotational media being bumped and getting damaged while you are using your MPC. The nice thing about the internal drive is that when you go into controller mode on your MPC it will be mount the drive to your computer so that you can access it, and this is pretty high speed compared to most USB drives and SD cards.\nAs for disk formats, since the MPC is linux based, it supports ext, ExFAT, Fat32, and plenty of others. My advice is to format USB Drives and SD Cards to Fat32 for the broadest compatibility with other devices, and to format your internal drive to ExFAT.\nMounting USB On the MPC Live and X you are able to mount your drive. This is not something you can do on the MPC One. This difference is pretty lame in my mind, but it is what it is.\nThe process to mount your MPC drives to your computer is pretty simple. From your MAIN menu tap the house icon, or press the MENU button, which will bring up the screen below.\nFrom here you will want to touch the computer chip icon that says MPC on it, which will then bring you to the option to change to controller mode.\nTouch CONTROLLER MODE on the bottom if you\u0026rsquo;re ready to switch to controller mode. It will say \u0026ldquo;Looking for computer\u0026rdquo;, which is indicating that it is trying to find the software running on your computer.\nNow, you may not care about loading the software, and if you\u0026rsquo;ve got the USB connection between the MPC and your computer setup already, then you\u0026rsquo;ll see the drives mounted and ready for use. Just remember to unmount your MPC drives from your computer before you disconnect your MPC and exit standalone mode.\nFinally, to exit standalone mode, just touch the STANDALONE icon and you will be set to disconnect from your computer.\nSamples The new MPC line supports a lot of different file formats from .WAV, .MP3, .AIFF, etc\u0026hellip; The manual details this more, but you should be able to load a lot of different types of content and media on your MPC without too much hassle.\nAt one point I did try to see if I could get some sample CDs working over a USB CD device, but the MPC didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to want to mount it. Perhaps a newer USB CD device would work, but this was an area where I just moved on when it didn\u0026rsquo;t work with the limited resources I had on hand to give it a try.\nOutput Volume For the outputs labelled 1/2 and L/R (they are the same), you do have a volume knob to control the output levels. Further, this output is linked to the headphone jack, whatever the volume output level is for either will essentially be effected the same by the volume knob.\nFor the Live and X, you also have additional outputs 3/4/5/6, and in the case of the X you\u0026rsquo;ve also got 7/8. These outputs are always output at the same level. If you want to change the outputs of them you\u0026rsquo;ll either need to adjust the sounds in the program, or on the MAIN mixer where you are outputting to those audio outputs. That\u0026hellip; or assuming you are routing those outputs to some kind of mixer, adjust the levels at the mixer.\nPad Sensitivity Personally I love the default sensitivity of the MPC Live and MPC X. I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried the MPC One, so I don\u0026rsquo;t know how it fairs there, but compared to other MPCs I have used, these pads feel great to me.\nI know that you can get thick pads, but honestly, I have not found it necessary. Some day when I tear down my MPC Live I might look into it, but unlike the MPC 500 and MPC 1000 as examples, I feel like the velocity responds incredibly well to my pad hits.\nThat said, I have seen some people struggle with double taps and ghost notes. I suspect that this is more an issue with playing styles, but this hasn\u0026rsquo;t been a problem for me. When I get a light note I know it was because I accidentally hit the pad a little too softly or came to a rest on the pad when I had not meant to.\nI\u0026rsquo;d be interested to hear what others have to say about the thicker pads, and I do think they fully transparent pads look kind of neat, but I fear that it would be distracting having so much \u0026ldquo;blinking lights\u0026rdquo; going on while playing.\nOver on MPC-Forums in MPC Live 2 Retro - Pad Sensitivity thread Ultros said he tightened the screws on his MPC and was able to get better sensitivity. I haven\u0026rsquo;t had a sensitivity problem on my MPC so can\u0026rsquo;t confirm, but this may be something worth trying if you\u0026rsquo;re having issues and don\u0026rsquo;t mind opening your MPC up to see if it might help.\nFull Level and 16 Levels Compared to previous MPCs, I hardly ever feel the need to reach for Full Level, though occasionally I will put it into Half Level mode if I want a section that is consistently quieter.\n16 Levels though gives you a lot of fine control, and can be used to give you 16 levels of tune, velocity, filter, layer, attack, and decay. This is quite a bit of different options, and if you are used to using just the 16 pads to put something together is a wide amount of options to dig into.\nA quick note on 16 Levels though, you can only use one per note event, and if you want to edit this information, you have to do it in LIST EDIT. Below is a picture showing this. MOD TYPE is the column that is the 16 Level modifier and you can see in this example you can only have one of Tuning, Filter, Layer, Attack, Decay, etc\u0026hellip;\nSo, it can be a bit annoying to get at and edit later, but honestly, I\u0026rsquo;d still rather have 16 Levels available as a feature, and if you need to dig deeper into a sound you should probably be creating a key group or copy pads to make variations on your sounds.\nExpansion Packs When you buy your MPC there are a number of expansion packs that come with it. Some will be installed, but you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to go to your Akai Pro account to download and install the rest. Some of the older packs need to be installed into the Akai MPC Software, and then exported to a drive accessible by your MPC before you can use them in standalone mode. It is super annoying, and I have no idea why Akai hasn\u0026rsquo;t updated these older packs to use their standalone model, but it is what it is.\nAs for where to get them, there are a lot of places. Akai Pro offers expansion packs themself, and while they are good, I\u0026rsquo;d personally wait for discount codes. A few times a year Akai sends out 50% off coupons for their expansion packs, and this can obviously help stretch your investment. So unless you are dying for something they have, it\u0026rsquo;s worth the wait in my mind. My understanding of the Beats software and the Beats expansion packs is that they will work in the regular MPC Software or on your MPC, but a lot of (if not all of) the content looks like it is just paired down versions of the full expansion packs you can get for the MPC. My suspicion is that for most of it, you\u0026rsquo;d just be getting duplicate content. That said, I have not purchased any of the Beats expansion packs to determine this for myself.\nI\u0026rsquo;d also suggest going to MPC Samples, this is MPC Tutor\u0026rsquo;s site, and is one of the few ways that he gets support for running MPC Forums. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten several of his sample packs and expansions, and I\u0026rsquo;ve found them all to be incredibly useful.\nNoise Floor Personally I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any problems with the noise floor of my MPCs. Yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s analogue, you\u0026rsquo;re going to pick up a bit of noise each time you record. Yeah, it is annoying that there is no digital input/output on the new MPC line. Still, I find it acceptable and honestly if you\u0026rsquo;ve got a clean signal and just make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t have any weird grounding issues or bad cables I\u0026rsquo;d say by and large you won\u0026rsquo;t have any problems.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll add that Black Lion Audio offers an MPC X Upgrade, but it is silly how expensive it is. Maybe it is worth it to some, but I just find this to be a waste of money. Sure they might be able to do some corrections and lower the noise floor a bit further, but I am just not sure to what end, and I doubt that it will make a difference in most people\u0026rsquo;s sound.\nSampling For me sampling on the MPC Live has been a real treat. Autosampler opens up a lot of possibilities for being able to record songs off of gear and virtual instruments while continuing to stay inside the box. As I said above, the Noise Floor isn\u0026rsquo;t really bothering me, and I find it a reasonably quick way to work. You can sample and assign to pads or create key groups quickly, and the quality is great. Sure I miss some of the modulation and routing available on some of the other Akai Samplers, but it hasn\u0026rsquo;t slowed down my workflow on the Akai MPC Live when it has come up.\nWarping The warping on the MPC in standalone is okay. I\u0026rsquo;m not a huge fan of it, but it can certainly get the job done. One thing of note is that there is a bit of a better mode you can get access to, but you have to know where to go. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t mind dedicating a bit more of your CPU to warping here\u0026rsquo;s how to switch between Basic and Pro Ten warping modes.\nPress your MENU button to open up your menu, then touch the gear icon in the top middle of the MAIN MODE bar.\nThis will then bring you to the PREFERENCES menu, which will allow you to make changes to your MPC settings.\nScroll down until you see GENERAL, and touch that, and then scroll down until you see AUIO WARP ALGORITHM. Basic gets you the original warping of the MPC, and Pro Ten gets you the higher quality version of the warping algorithm.\nWireless The MPC Live and X support wireless connections. I am not sure if the MPC One supports wireless or not off hand.\nThis is primarily used for four things, you can do some midi sync\u0026rsquo;ing by installing a driver on your computer, you can do Ableton Sync (which does not require you to run Ableton Live running) to sync to other apps and hardware that support the Ableton Sync protocol, there is Live Control mode which does require you to have Ableton Live so you can control it, and finally you can use wireless to download content from Splice.\nFor me, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a great set of features, but it is something that is available for those who are interested. I find the most interesting is the Ableton Sync, which you can use to sync up with external loopers or other gear. Again, it\u0026rsquo;s probably not going to knock your socks off, but it is handy to have it in your bag of tricks.\nEthernet Similar to the wireless connection, you\u0026rsquo;ve also got Ethernet, which brings pretty much the same set of features for midi (but over ethernet), Ableton Sync, Live Control, and Splice.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in any of those features, the ethernet port is absolutely the way to go because it is a faster, more stable, and lower latency connection. If you have the opportunity this is how I would go.\nOn the forums, somebody was looking to sync two MPCs together, and this is the way I would do it, either with a hub or using a direct ethernet connection between the two MPCs and then sync them with Ableton Sync. It\u0026rsquo;s one less cable, but gives some more potential options if you want them.\nBluetooth The MPC Live and X support bluetooth, which opens up some interesting additional options. Sadly the MPC One lacks this, and again feels like a missed opportunity, but who am I to judge?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve posted a bunch of videos on Youtube showing how to use Bluetooth to send midi predominantly, yes it is laggy, sure it could drop some packets, but when you\u0026rsquo;ve only got one port on your iPhone or iPad, it may be the simplest way to just route notes from the MPC and be able to setup Autosampling.\nAnother good use for Bluetooth is setting up a keyboard. You can use this as a way to at least type in names quickly whenever you touch the menu that opens the keyboard, and enter a track name, program name, sample name, or whatever quickly. You are still restricted to the same keys that the MPC will support in the menu, but I know I am much faster at typing on a keyboard than on the touch screen.\nUnfortunately there is no mouse support, so you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to use a Bluetooth mouse to click away. Maybe in a future update? I can only hope.\nControl Voltage All of the MPCs except for the original MPC Live support sending control voltage. The MPC X has all 8 control voltages separated to their own TR port.\nThe MPC Live II and MPC One however have 4 CV ports that each can carry two CV signals over a TRS cable. I posted about the TRS splitter I used at Akai MPC Live mk2 / One CV outs post I made a while ago, but I would expect most any TRS to dual TR splitters ought to do the trick as long as they use the proper connection for common ground.\nFor CV cables, I personally got a pack of multi colored cables so that I can keep my sanity on which cable associates with CV1 through CV8\u0026hellip; with cables red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purlple, brown, and grey being the order I connected everything.\nMastering Yeah\u0026hellip; you can absolutely do everything in the box\u0026hellip; and if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something to step up your game, definitely check out https://www.yorgosarabatzis.space and look into the MPC mastering suite he\u0026rsquo;s put together. Do you need it? No, but it does a lot of heavy lifting. I find the best results when I try and mix to around -9db to -15db, the lower you mix, the more it tends to open up.\nSerial Number If you\u0026rsquo;re having issues with your serial number and the MPC not having a serial number check out this post over at MPC Forums. The topic covers how to get into the diagnostics and enter the serial number to get around the problem.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/05/21/you-just-bought-an-akai-mpc-live-x-one-what-next/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFolks seem to have liked the \u003ca href=\"/2021/01/18/so-you-just-bought-an-akai-mpc-500-what-next/\"\u003eYou just bought an Akai MPC 500, what next?\u003c/a\u003e post, so it\u0026rsquo;s about time to put one together for the MPC Live/X/One family of MPCs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"internal-storage\"\u003eInternal Storage\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am moving this to the top, as a warning to MPC buyers.

The steps are pretty straightforward, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to add the steps below as well for those that would prefer to skip the video and just want some text to follow along.\nAkai MPC Live/X/One Setup\nOn you\u0026rsquo;re MPC, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to head over to the menu by pressing the MENU button. This will get you into your normal menu. You can choose to have the top middle setting SYNC to Off or something else, but personally I\u0026rsquo;d just turn it off since in this case we just want the MPC to control the master sync.\nNext, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to touch the gear icon on the top so we can get into the Preferences menu, and then go to the MIDI / SYNC menu on the left. Here you can see I have the OP-1 Midi Device MIDI 1 with only the SYNC option turned on in the OUTPUT PORTS section.\nThe only thing that I do want to note, is that if you recorded content on your OP-1 already, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to make sure the BPM on your Akai MPC matches the BPM of the content you recorded on your OP-1. Yes, the Akai MPC will now sync the BPM to your OP-1, but if they do not match, your OP-1 tape loops are going to be out of sync with your MPC.\nTeenage Engineering OP-1 Setup\nFor the other half of this, you\u0026rsquo;ve got one setting to change on your OP-1, and that\u0026rsquo;s in the tempo menu. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know which button is the tempo button, well it\u0026rsquo;s the one on the upper lefthand side of the keyboard that looks like a triangle with a line coming out of it. That\u0026rsquo;s a pretty generic metronome symbol.\nIn my case below, you can see that the OP-1 is set to a BPM of 87.0, and the Tape Speed is 1:1, this is the TSPEED that you want to get the best quality out of the OP-1.\nAt any rate, to get the OP-1 Tape to sync with the MPC Live, you\u0026rsquo;re going to want to rotate the Green Knob until it looks like this, which is letting you know that the BPM and TSPEED are linked together, and that the OP-1 is Syncing to an external clock.\nFrom here on out, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to use the transport controls on your MPC to start and stop playback.\nHave fun!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/05/10/how-to-sync-your-op-1-to-your-mpc-live-x-one/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/V7aN9cKaqYU\"\u003ehttps://youtu.be/V7aN9cKaqYU\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just a quick video to walk you through how to sync a Teenage Engineering OP-1 to an Akai MPC Live/X/One over USB.

Since I had it setup already, I just used it all from my iPad, but this will work on other external gear as well.\nhttps://youtu.be/0peJwPHkcW0\nSince I\u0026rsquo;m sure some of the things I was doing in the video will be a little tough to catch from the angle and size of the screen, I\u0026rsquo;m going to outline all the steps below as well.\nEquipment used:\nHyperDrive HD319 - This is handling usb and audio duties\u0026hellip; great piece of kit for your iPad.\nRoland UM-ONE - USB to Midi duties\u0026hellip; nothing fancy\nNow on with the steps\u0026hellip; assuming you\u0026rsquo;ve got everything hooked up.\nAkai MPC Live/X/One\nFirst, make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve setup a MIDI track, and you\u0026rsquo;ve got your MIDI PORT setup properly. In my case, I have the Roland UM-ONE hooked up to the MPC A MIDI port. Boy, that\u0026rsquo;s a lot of upper case letters.\nNext, I usually just hold down the Q-LINK button to open up the Q-LINK menu, but you can also get to it through the MENU button and then touching Q-LINK EDIT button on the screen.\nAssuming you\u0026rsquo;re holding the Q-LINK button down, then you\u0026rsquo;ll want to touch the Q-LINK EDIT button on the touch screen. Again, either way will get you there, but this is just the muscle memory that I have developed.\nRegardless of how you get to the Q-LINK Edit page, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to change to the PROGRAM menu, so that we can edit the Q-LINKs for the program we have selected.\nHere you can see that some settings are already defined, and you\u0026rsquo;ll likely find that Modulation, Expression, and Volume (possibly even Pan) are already mapped to whatever synth you\u0026rsquo;re controlling. Other Q-LINK settings here may also control parameters already on your synth\u0026hellip; you can change the parameters and see what does and does not work for you.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also note, there is absolutely no problem in wiping out or over writing the Q-LINKS to control other parameters. You can see in the picture here that I changed Q-LINK 16 to CC 104, just to show that you can change it to whatever you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nAt any rate, this should get you on the MPC side to work properly. As a last note to leave you with before moving over to Arturia iMini\u0026hellip; don\u0026rsquo;t forget that you can save programs, so if you want to setup a template for a specific synth and save it, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to name your Program so you remember what it goes to, and save it someplace you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to find in the future.\nArturia iMini\nYou can skip this section if you don\u0026rsquo;t particularly care about Arturia iMini, but I\u0026rsquo;m adding it since I showed it off in the video.\nAssuming you\u0026rsquo;ve setup the above on your iPad, this next steps will just guide you through the MIDI Learn process in iMini.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see here, just the opening page for iMini, nothing special, and all of the MIDI settings you\u0026rsquo;ll want to get access to are hidden through touching the CONNECT button.\nOnce you touch on CONNECT, a hidden menu above will pull down, and this is where we need to be to access MIDI settings.\nGo ahead and touch MIDI to open the MIDI specific settings.\nThe popup below shows you which MIDI Channel iMini is listening to, which devices it sees, and importantly for this exercise it has the MIDI LEARN button so that we can specify which MIDI CC\u0026rsquo;s to use for different knobs and buttons on the MPC (or other devices you choose to use).\nThis will open up a view where the blew circles are telling you which parameters are already mapped to something if they are checked, and when you touch a circle it will turn green to let you know it is learning whatever knob you change next.\nI hope this helps you get setup and using more synths with your MPC!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/05/07/using-q-links-on-your-mpc-live-x-one-to-control-midi-cc-on-your-ipad-or-other-gear/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eJust a quick video to answer a comment from a viewer, and help show how to use Q-Links on your MPC to control external gear.

Personally, I bought the $59.95 for one year support. Heck, I used to use this product to play games ten or so years ago, so I\u0026rsquo;m a bit familiar with it still. I had lapsed from using it because I had been using Bootcamp so much, but I have subsequently stopped upgrading my Parallels VM, and honestly, games run pretty poorly through Virtual Machines, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be booting into bootcamp to play games.\nSo\u0026hellip; I crossed my fingers, and so far have had plenty of success! Also, I think you can get a 14 day trial license, so you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to pay money out of the gate. For those of you with M1 processors, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this will work due to how WINE works, so if you wanted to give it a try I suppose you can, but I\u0026rsquo;d be shocked if you didn\u0026rsquo;t need some form of QEMU or other processor emulation as well to get anything to work.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re going to follow along, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to either use a trial license or purchase a license one way or another for Crossover. Codeweavers makes this supported product, and you can pick it up at https://www.codeweavers.com. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve purchased your license, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to download the software. Personally, the lifetime license seems a bit excessive at nearly $500, especially for Mac users who I figure are not going to have much need for this product once they move over to the M1 and beyond based products. Buyer beware? For me, while I use Linux a lot, it hasn\u0026rsquo;t really been a primary gaming system for me.\nInstalling CrossOver\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve got the file downloaded, go ahead and install it. Personally, I just unpacked the file and copied the application to my Applications folder. Once copied, I opened it up and then added the license through the prompt by logging into my CodeWeavers account. Again, if you\u0026rsquo;re just going to check out the trial, then feel free to put it into trial mode. Unfortunately I didn\u0026rsquo;t capture any screenshots for these steps, but it should be pretty self explanatory.\nInstall Windows Application\nThe main trick of CrossOver is simulating a Windows environment so that your programs can make API calls out and have CrossOver handle them. So to get CrossOver to do it\u0026rsquo;s magic we\u0026rsquo;re going to tell it to install a Windows application along with all the components necessary to actually run it.\nGo ahead and click \u0026ldquo;Install a Windows Application\u0026rdquo; to get started. You\u0026rsquo;ll then be brought to the screen below to select an application. I just typed in Steam and then selected the dropdown \u0026ldquo;Steam\u0026rdquo; from the list.\nThis should then bring you to a screen that gives you some information about the application.\nOnce you believe you are ready to move forward, just click Continue on the bottom right of the window.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re now going to see something like the image above. This is showing you all of the additional content that needs to be installed in order to support Steam so that it can run on your Mac. There are going to be a few pop ups that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to select \u0026ldquo;continue\u0026rdquo; or otherwise approve licenses in order to install.\nFor example, above you can see that I needed to say \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; to accept the Verdana font installation.\nSimilarly I needed to go through the Microsoft XML Parser Setup Wizard to get this content installed inside the bottle for Steam.\nAgain, assuming you accept the EULA, go ahead and accept it, it is necessary to run Steam. I might have missed a license screen or two, but hopefully you get the idea. I just wanted to make sure you it is clear that this is normal behavior of the CrossOver and Steam installation process.\nInstalling Steam\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve installed Steam before, all of these dialogues will look familiar. If you\u0026rsquo;re ready to install Steam just hit Next.\nThis will lead you to an Updating Steam dialogue box that shows you that it is downloading updates.\nWhen it is done, CrossOver will let you know that the Steam installation is complete.\nRunning Steam\nYou should now see a screen similar to what I captured below. This is showing you the applications that you have installed in the Steam bottle. Go ahead and double click on Steam to start it.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll be presented with a screen to either log into an existing account, or create a new account. Either way, get yourself logged in.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;re probably going to see a screen that looks something like below. It looks like you have no games, and when you go to Library you\u0026rsquo;ll likewise see nothing. I believe that this has been a common and longstanding issue with Steam running through CrossOver for a while now, but I\u0026rsquo;m not quite sure for how long that it has been an issue.\nI tried increasing my window size in an attempt to resolve this. But that didn\u0026rsquo;t help, the rendering section was still black. To resolve this I tried tweaking a few settings in CrossOver, but none of them ultimately helped. Instead what I did was to go to View and then select \u0026ldquo;Small Mode\u0026rdquo; from the dropdown, and suddenly I could see all of my games again. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure of a workflow to purchase games through the Steam app, but you can certainly purchase them through the webpage if necessary.\nHere you can see I have the option to \u0026ldquo;Install Game\u0026rdquo;, and assuming you have it in your library, go ahead and install it. Once it is installed, you can double click on the icon in order to start the game.\nBelow you can see here is my first game getting it running on Mac!\nConclussion\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure there are other ways to get Repentance to work on a Mac, but I wanted to write this up for anybody who might be excited to play the game, but isn\u0026rsquo;t exactly enthused that Mac is no longer supported. For you, I hold my glass up high, and hope you\u0026rsquo;re able to get some joy out of the game!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/04/04/running-the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-natively-on-intel-based-apple-hardware/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAlright folks\u0026hellip; normally I don\u0026rsquo;t get into video games on this site, but since Repentance is not going to be supported on Intel based Apple hardware\u0026hellip; well I figured I\u0026rsquo;d write up a tutorial to get you going.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this \u0026ldquo;how to\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to get Crossover for your Mac.

Cool kid.\nTo put this together I drove samples into the SP 303 C and D banks. They are much faster to sample on, even though it is still quite slow compared to modern standards. It was a pretty good way to test out the repair job that I did for the pads as well, since I was bouncing around a lot of the buttons, minus the pattern stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much I care to bother with pattern sequencing here when I can just resample everything into the MPC. So I filled up all 16 smart media sample slots between bank C and D\u0026hellip; The samples came in between a mix of raw, and sometimes with some effects already running, and I did end up adding effects on the way out back into the MPC as well to make a drum kit.\nThe majoring of effects used are Isolator, Radio, Bit Reducer, Distortion, and Pitch. I probably used Vinyl as well, but I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, for how \u0026ldquo;legendary\u0026rdquo; everybody makes it out to be, while a nice effect, I\u0026rsquo;m not sweating on it yet. So yeah, the sample session was a lot of finding good samples to load in, and then working my way through SP 303 effects to tweak things to where I thought I might want them to go as final sounds on the MPC. Oh and heck\u0026hellip; I really need to learn the Mark button better. I mean I totally get what it does, but how it operates I haven\u0026rsquo;t quite got my head around yet. I did get some good progress though by playing the sample with Mark, and then tweaking the Start/End point with the Start/End/Level(?) button. I am not perfect at this yet, but I am willing to bet that it is a really quick process.\nI do suspect though that there is some fun to be had with the Pattern mode on the SP 303, but I just know my way around the MPC so well that I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I want to bother. I know I should so I can see how it works, but maybe someday.\nAnyways\u0026hellip; the track is all sampled through the SP 303, and then I sampled hits back into the MPC to make a drum kit. The process wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad, and probably spent as much time naming samples as anything. There was the odd part where I tweaked samples enough that they now sounded like something else\u0026hellip; so I just named some of them what they reminded me of.\nI think the only sound that really got any effects treatment was the Space Horn\u0026hellip; I liked it, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t sitting well with the rest of the tracks I had played out. I ended up driving this through a few effects like talk box and gated filter to try and get it a little bit more tamed and change the audible characteristics of it. From there, having a 4 bar track I just exploded it and then got to track muting to pull the whole song together. There\u0026rsquo;s still a few sloppy sections, but I kinda dig the sound :D\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/04/03/where-my-boys/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDay 3\u0026hellip; This track I mostly wanted to mess around with the Boss SP 303 to understand the sampling workflow a bit better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/where-my-boys\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/where-my-boys\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture is Isaac from the game \u0026ldquo;The Binding of Isaac\u0026rdquo;.

So I filled up all 16 smart media sample slots between bank C and D\u0026hellip; The samples came in between a mix of raw, and sometimes with some effects already running, and I did end up adding effects on the way out back into the MPC as well to make a drum kit.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Where My Boys"},{"content":"Had 30 minutes\u0026hellip; and knocked out a second quick track for day two.

It showed up, and it smells like either a musty arcade, or somebody\u0026rsquo;s basement. Clearly the SP has been in storage for a *long* time, and I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that the scent is going away. The description for the SP 303 was Very Good condition, but when it arrived some of the pads were shot. Most importantly, the record pad just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work at all.\nHere you can see that the SP 303 isn\u0026rsquo;t in awful condition, but it\u0026rsquo;s also not Very Good by my idea of Very Good. The rust you can see on the bottom leads me to believe that the SP 303 was kept someplace damp, and I may decide to sand blast and repaint the sides to repair it.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the other side\u0026hellip;\nSurprisingly the bottom has faired much better, possibly from the rubber feet keep it from getting banged around too much.\nAt any rate, you\u0026rsquo;re not here to see what the case looks like I suppose, and I figured this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the end of the world, and I should be able to repair the pads as long as the PCB traces were still in tact. The device looked pretty simple, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine the technology inside it was anything terribly sophisticated.\nI wouldn\u0026rsquo;t try this at home unless you know what you are doing (ie powering it on without the case on), but below you can see I took it apart while trying to test things out, and you can see it is just two PSB boards, so yeah, it\u0026rsquo;s not too bad. My initial guess on why the pads were not working was because either the contacts on the PCB were oxidized or otherwise dirty, or the pads themselves had the conductive material worn off of them.\nTo just try out a few things, I moved the sheet around and positioned different pads over different parts that weren\u0026rsquo;t working. Notably, the B bank button, and record were not working. I took some rubbing alcohol to the circuit board, and I ended up getting a lot of graphite off of the contacts. Likely this was from the pads, but it\u0026rsquo;s also possible that the contacts are coated with a graphite paint or something. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, and didn\u0026rsquo;t bother to find a service manual or anything that might describe it. So for what is coated on the PCB traces, your guess is as good as mine.\nTaking the SP 303 Apart\nYeah here\u0026rsquo;s the picture of the bottom again. Before you can get the case off you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to take these 5 screws off. These five screws hold the top and bottom halves of the case together.\nHere you should be able to find the two screws on the back, and these hold the lower PCB that has the brains of the SP 303 to the back of the bottom part of the case. So before you can proceed remove these two screws as well.\nMy SP 303 didn\u0026rsquo;t come with the SmartMedia face plate cover, so you might need to remove these two screws as well. As you can see, I just have an exposed SmartMedia card\u0026hellip; *shrug*. The two screws are on the bottom of the SP 303\u0026hellip; but just take a look for yourself.\nOnce you have the screws off, the SP 303 should open up pretty easily. Go slow as there are ribbon cables connecting the two PCBs together, but it should not come apart hard. From here you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see the five screw holes/mount points from the bottom of the SP 303 PCB.\nOnce you have the two halves separated you\u0026rsquo;ll see that there are eight more screws you\u0026rsquo;ll need to remove. Hint: One of the screws is under the plastic plate. You\u0026rsquo;ll also want to make sure that you put that metal piece back on that is in the top left screw. I suspect that this is for grounding or something, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend much time figuring out what function it provided. Just make sure you put that metal tab and plastic shield back in place :D\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve removed all the screws, you can now pull the SP 303 PCBs out of the top half of the case to expose your pads.\nAt this point, it\u0026rsquo;s probably a good idea to do whatever cleaning you were planning on doing. Scare off the dust bunnies, knock back any grease or beer. Whatever you find that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there can go. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest using rubbing alcohol for this cleaning process as it dries quickly and is less likely to cause you issues with conductivity or causing rust when you put the SP 303 back together.\nPad Repair\nIn my case, upon close inspection, I could see that the graphite or conductive material was broken and worn out on some of the pads. So I figured I\u0026rsquo;d give CaiKote 44 a try. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly expensive, but 1g of this silver/carbon based \u0026ldquo;paint\u0026rdquo; should last you a good while. I did find that the included swabs were a bit messy to work with even though I soldiered on. If I did this again, I\u0026rsquo;d probably choose to use some small paint brushes instead because the cotton became a bit painful to have to keep trimming so that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting the contact solution all over the place.\nEven though only a few of the pads were non functional, I decided I would just apply the CaiKote 44 to all of them while I was inside so I would be less likely to have to come back again later to do this. The package says it dries in about 15 minutes, and gives some curing instructions with a bulb, but I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just let it dry out for the day.\nIn the above picture you can see that I got paint all over the place as well. Just to be save, I scrapped the excess paint off with my Swiss army knife. It flaked off very easily and I ended up with the paint being applied only to the pads. I then carefully powered on the SP 303 while it was still outside of the case, and tested the pads. A few of them were still behaving a bit off, or required a bit more force than I expected.\nTo fix this, for a couple of the PCB traces I just used a graphite pencil and drew on top to see if that would help. Below you can see for the Bank B pad (SW35) I just drew on top of it. I got a bit outside of the contact traces, but I did get a magnifying glass to make sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t short anything. I would save this as a last case solution, because honestly, these traces look like they should work.\nConclusion\nWell I am now able to use the SP 303 as intended, and as far as I can tell, all of the buttons now work. So anything that comes out of it that sounds poor is likely my fault, and not the SP 303\u0026rsquo;s fault.\nIf I have any problems with the CaiKote 44 flaking off I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely make sure to update this post, but for the time being it has definitely been holding up.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/04/02/boss-sp-303-pad-repair/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI bought a Boss SP 303, which was obviously used.

I grabbed a handful of samples and just got to chopping. I know I could have done a better job getting some of the slices together, but I tried to do it by ear as much as possible, and hey, I continue to approve of the slightly wonky and janky sound. So it was a lot of using the threshold chop mode to get the party started, and then adjusting the start/end points a bit by ear. I know for sure that a few of the mistakes in the chops came from forgetting to turn off the linked slices afterwards, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t really been doing much for tracks over the last TWO months, which has gotten me quite a bit out of practice. Only done a few hit or miss beat battles in between, and I hadn\u0026rsquo;t even bothered to write up a post about them. Well, I do need to get myself more focussed again\nHonestly, to kick off making the tracks, I started with mostly putting together a handful of two bar patterns, the kick and snare, with a bit of high hit thrown in for good measure. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even go back to make any changes to it\u0026hellip; *sigh*. Maybe next time. From there I quickly realized that I\u0026rsquo;d want to go for four bar measures for a few of the sections, notably the flute and string sounds, because what I was tapping out needed a bit more space to come together and resolve.\nThis lead me to a bit of mixing, because I was getting a lot of digital clipping and I basically dropped all the tracks down roughly -9db to give myself more headroom, which I promptly kept eating into by adding the harp like sound and some more percussion. Plus at this point the sounds were starting to interfere with each other making it a bit harder to pick them out, so I put a generous amount of filtering on most of the tracks just to take out some of the harsher sounds and help them all sit in their own frequency ranges a bit more nicely.\nAt this point, I had doubled the sequence again to eight measures, and just popped it out to sixty four measures by doubling it three more times. This left me with a track that I just hammered through the track mutes by hand\u0026hellip; which mostly worked fine, but you can definitely hear some of the poor timing I did leaving a few of the transitions feeling a bit off. I absolutely need to practice this some more, as I clearly have gotten out of practice some doing this a few months ago.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/04/02/spring-is-here/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis track is better than yesterday\u0026hellip; though still needs some tweaking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/spring-is-here\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/spring-is-here\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture is just some flowers that my wife bought\u0026hellip; Calla Lilies if you\u0026rsquo;re interested.

The track itself is a great mix of different synths, pads, chords, percussion, and other elements. You can go quite a few different ways for this beat battle for sure.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb306-my-way\nI worked on this track over a couple of days. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite sure what I wanted to do with it, but figured I\u0026rsquo;d dirty up the track a bit.\nThe first thing I did was hook up an FM broadcaster to my laptop, tuned in the OP-1 to the same station, and then recorded the audio over the airwaves. This gave the sound a bit more of that old time noise and grit, but also had the effect of making the track mono since the OP-1 doesn\u0026rsquo;t record content in as stereo.\nFrom there I just started scrubbing the OP-1 tape to listen for sounds that seemed like they could stand alone, or that I could filter a bit in order to help isolate some of the sounds. I really just focussed on the first 20 seconds of the track as the intro had most of the isolated sounds for chords, bass, pads, etc. Throughout a lot of the intro there is a rhythmic drum sound that I mostly just left in the samples. The drums were a bit more tricky and required some filtering to get rid of some of the other sounds of other instruments, but it was not too bad to work with.\nSo to get the different parts of the song out on the OP-1, I just kept scrubbing to the start and end points of sound and using the cut function. Once I liked the sound I would do a quick lift/drop to get the audio into the buffer, while also keeping the track coherent. Once I had the sample in the buffer, I then went to either the drum or synth sampler mode and dropped the sound into the sampler and started to experiment. Of the effects, I mostly used Nitro to get some filtering and resonance going and Phone to get some more glitched out effects. In particular for the drum sounds though, I ended up doing a few passes which required writing hits to tape and then cutting/lifting them to get them back into the sampler several times to commit some of the effects.\nOnce I had my sounds together I ended up making about ten four bar loops that I mostly played out by hand and wrote to tape loops on the OP-1. This got me the initial sound and song structure, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really looking forward to lifting and dropping loops from the OP-1 tape in order to build up a full track. I have done it in the past, but it just seemed like it would be a hassle.\nInstead, I decided to sample the loops one at a time into the MPC Live and then get back to chopping them up and playing out different variations. This didn\u0026rsquo;t take too long, and gave me a chance to do some more sound design with the content. Once I had all the components done in the MPC as drum kits and key groups, I then moved on to laying out tracks and mixing everything together.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;d say it was pretty fun using both devices together, and I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely look into doing it again. The tape track on the OP-1 definitely gives some different opportunities for music production, and I just know my way around the MPC so much better.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/03/09/mpcbb306-my-way/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis week\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40\u0026amp;t=210648\"\u003eMPC Forums Beat Battle 306\u003c/a\u003e is still open for one more day.

It is not exactly straight forward, and I had to dig through a lot of old posts and try and understand what exactly different sources were trying to tell me. I found a few that indicated that it should work polyphonically, but didn\u0026rsquo;t exactly describe the steps to get there, or said things a little too generically. I can say, I now have it all working (yeah!), and will go through how to get this setup step by step, where you might hit a few problems, suggestions to test out issues. Let\u0026rsquo;s get into it :D\nHardware Setup\nFirst thing is first, you\u0026rsquo;re going to need a few things\u0026hellip; an Akai VX90, and Akai S950, a 13-pin cable, and a midi controller than can output midi notes.\nSorry, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to be able to help you with sourcing the Akai gear\u0026hellip; and I understand, it is super pricey.\nBelow is what the 13 pin connector looks like. I ended up getting mine off of eBay, by searching for \u0026quot; 13-PIN MIDI ROLAND GUITAR SYNTH INTERFACE CABLE\u0026quot;. The one I got is pin compatible, and I believe can actually carry all eight voices of the Akai S950 over, but\u0026hellip; for this application we\u0026rsquo;re only going to be able to use six of the eight voices, since the Akai VX90 can only support six voices. For those of you wondering, you really cannot take advantage of the other two voices in a meaningful way, so while I may look into a few applications in the future, just consider this a six voice only operation. If you want to experiment go nuts, but you\u0026rsquo;ll be on your own :D\nThe back end of both of your synths should look similar. Though you might not have the IB-105/IB-109 on your S950. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if you do not have either, we won\u0026rsquo;t be using those connections for this setup.\nOf note though, and before things get covered with cables, is that you\u0026rsquo;ll want to pay attention to the SAMPLER IN, MIDI IN, and MIDI OUT on your VX90, and VOICE OUT and MIDI IN on your S950. The VX90 does some MIDI magic to transform incoming notes into different MIDI Channel events on the S950 over the MIDI OUT port, so you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to take advantage of MIDI THRU without a lot of rewiring and other things I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not going to cover here.\nAs you can see, the 13 pin cable I got is ridiculously long, but even though it is about six feet long, it still works fine. So go ahead and plug that into your VX90 SAMPLER IN port, and your S950 VOICE OUT port. Just be careful to make sure that your pins are aligned correctly, and you should be all set.\nNext up is plugging in your MIDI. From your controller, plug the MIDI OUT into the VX90 MIDI IN. If you want to test it, you can just try and play some notes from your VX90 right now if you\u0026rsquo;ve got it hooked up to a mixer.\nThen from the VX90 MIDI OUT, hook that up into your S950 MIDI IN. This will get you all of the routing that you should need setup through hardware for the MIDI.\nFinally, hook up the audio from the VX90 to your input. In my case I used the Phono outputs in the front of the VX90 because my STEREO outs on the VX90 are quite noisy. Something to repair in the future for certain.\nAkai VX90 Setup\nWith all of that completed, you now have the hardware configured properly, but besides seeing if the VX90 plays, you are not likely going to be able to hear your S950 samples quite yet, because now we need to configure the software to actually do something.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with the VX90 configuration. To configure the VX90, you\u0026rsquo;re doing to need to press the EDIT button. You can see it is on for me because the red LED has turned on, and I now see in the menu Exx to indicate I am in edit mode.\nNext we\u0026rsquo;ll need to move over to the menu item E06 to configure the Sampler mode. To navigate through your edit options, look to the SELECT or number buttons and you\u0026rsquo;ll see BWD to move backwards, and FWD to move forwards. In all likelihood you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use FWD to move over to E06, and then use the VALUE slider to make sure it is set to ON. Once it is on you will see the SAMPLER LED light up red, indicating that the VX90 can now receive audio information from the S950.\nNext up is to adjust a-b balance, which allows us to mix how much audio comes from the VX90 and how much comes from the S950. For now, let\u0026rsquo;s set it to 100, but later when you want to have two voices playing, you can adjust it to get a mix of the VX90 oscillator and S950 oscillator playing together.\nNext we\u0026rsquo;ll move on to option E10 to adjust the VCF. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest setting this to 100 as well, just to make sure that the filter is wide open for our application, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t interfere with our S950 program we\u0026rsquo;ll be creating next.\nSimilarly, I\u0026rsquo;ll suggest editing E11 to make sure that there isn\u0026rsquo;t any resonance for now that could cause us problems or confusion as we get started, so set the resonance to 00 for now.\nNext up, make sure your High Pass Filter is not impacting the sound by also setting it to 0. Again, this will be good to adjust once you\u0026rsquo;re ready to make some sounds, but for now it could just make things confusing when processing the S950, so just set it to 00.\nThe next two settings are for setting how the VX90 actually plays, and you can absolutely adjust these two settings as well, but setting them as directed for now will make sure that we have everything setup properly before we begin to experiment.\nFirst up, let\u0026rsquo;s have the VX90 be setup on Polyphonic mode, this ensures that when you play one note, it will play one oscillator from the VX90 and one oscillator from the S950. You can use DUAL or UNI later to stack the voices for a thicker sound, but the easiest way to test that everything is working properly is with POLY mode. So head over to E50 and set it to POLY.\nWe need to make sure E51 is 00 to disable portamento.\nLast but certainly not least, we need to make sure we have the MIDI channel on the VX90 set to MIDI channel 1. Head over to E70 and set the MIDI CH to 01.\nAkai S950 Setup\nWith all those settings changed, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to move over to the S950. Personally, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest an initial boot up without a disk, and we\u0026rsquo;ll just use the default TONE PRGRM to make sure everything works. You\u0026rsquo;ll have plenty of time to mess with samples later!\nAlso, if you want to try and skip all of the steps, I have provided a disk image at the end of this blog that is the TONE PRGRM that you will have created once you\u0026rsquo;ve completed all of the steps listed here.\nSo first up, and this hung me up on my S950, we need to make sure that we have OMNI turned off, otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to get Polyphonic sounds. The reason for this is because it the way we are going to setup the program it will play all eight S950 oscillators/samplers at the same time, consuming all of your polyphony. Which is almost certainly not what you want.\nTo disable OMNI, press the MIDI button to get into the MIDI menu, and on the first page you can arrow over to the Omni on/off, and press OFF on your PARAMETER KEY.\nWhile you are here, also make sure that your Basic MIDI channel is set to 1. I imagine you can play with this some, but if you\u0026rsquo;re following along with me, keep it at 1.\nNow, with our simple TONE PRGRM we have something to work with. We\u0026rsquo;ll need to go to EDIT PRGRM in order to make sure we have six key groups that will respond to each separate MIDI event uniquely for each VX90 received key press.\nPage down to the third page, and you should see that we currently only have one key group due to Select ( 0 to 1) indicating that we only have the one key group at this time.\nArrow over to Copy(+) and press the ON/+ button five times so that you now have six key groups to work with.\nNow the next part is a little tedious, but I am going to post pictures for all of the settings to make sure that everything matches up.\nPage down to page 16, and we will set the MIDI channel offset for each KG so that the MIDI ch. matches the key group. KG1 to MIDI ch. 1, KG2 to MIDI ch. 2, etc\u0026hellip;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry, you\u0026rsquo;re almost done and should be able to hear something shortly!\nThe last step is to now page down to page 17, so we can set the audio outputs. As we did for the MIDI channels, we now want the OUTPUTs to match the key groups. So KG1 is set to 1, KG2 is set to 2, KG3 is set to 3, etc\u0026hellip;\nNow, if everything is setup properly you *should* be able to hear some sounds! Start by playing a single note at a time, and play up and down the keyboard/pads of your controller. If you don\u0026rsquo;t hear anything, the first thing I would suggest checking is that you have monitoring turned on your device.\nOnce you can hear a single note playing at the same time, try playing a chord to make sure that you can hear individual notes playing at the same time. This is where I had made a mistake by not having OMNI turned off on the S950, and as soon as I turned it off everything worked as expected.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve got a Gotek drive, or can write an .hfe file to disk, the file below has a default program pre-setup to work with the VX90 so you could skip the steps above.\ns950-settings-for-vx90-setup Download\nConclusion\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve got the hardware, I\u0026rsquo;d say that this is pretty fun to mess around with. On the other hand, if you\u0026rsquo;re really considering dropping $1k or more for both the VX90 and the S950, I\u0026rsquo;d be pretty hard pressed to say that all of this is worth it. Both devices have a unique sound to them, and how they can operate with each other is even more unique, and likely rare to see the two together, but these old devices are something you\u0026rsquo;ll need to also factor in if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to repair, maintain, and keep working. All I am saying is that it is not a cheap investment, so just think about what you are getting in to.\nFor those of you who do have both devices though, definitely good luck putting it all together and I am sure you can record off some really cool sounds, key groups, and other things. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be experimenting and seeing what I can come up with, and will keep you guys posted on where it goes for sure.\nLinks\nLinks that had different and important information for putting this post together\nGraph Paper - Connecting the VX90 to the S950\nGraph Paper - Akai Sampler and Synths\nGear Sluts - How do people use the S950 in their setups?\nGear Sluts - One stupid question about the S950!

You still have time to submit a track :D\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb303-dream-in-a-music-box\nThe picture comes courtesy of a trip I took with my family and in-laws to a butterfly garden when the kids were just two or three. The girls really loved seeing all the insects in their natural habitat. Especially since it was winter outside, and in some sections nearly tropical from the level of humidity. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing to see the life cycle of these sometimes so foreign creatures.\nTo put the track together, I just sampled the intro, and went from there. I felt like it had enough harmonic content to work with, and while my initial instinct was to dirty it up a lot, I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t get too crazy here. I had been thinking a dirty track would be fun, but about the dirtiest this gets is just from the tape delay. I have to say though, the track has plenty of amazing content to work with and I\u0026rsquo;m definitely excited to see what the other submissions sound like.\nOnce I had the intro chopped up to my liking, I did have to tweak some of the notes. One of the notes in particular was very short, and I really liked the tone of it, but it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t fitting. I ended up opening my utility belt of tricks, and just put the note into a forward/backward loop so that it would keep the same tone, and not create too many clicks/pops or sound too awkward when doing it. Of course to do this I had to change the note from One Shot to Note On, and then there came a lot of messing around with ADSR to try and get the volume of the note to be somewhat similar to the other notes playing. I would give myself a \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; for how it sounds by itself, but in the mix I don\u0026rsquo;t even think you\u0026rsquo;d notice it unless you knew it was there and tried to look for it.\nI ended up recording a few variations of playing the notes out, straight, staggered, and kind of grooved out. From there I realized that I wanted these to make a bit more of a tapestry of sound, so duplicated my program to make a -12 semitone, as is, and +12 semitone version of the program, and then duped this for the playing style variations and program semi tone variations to build up a matrix.\nAt this point, I decided it was time to start laying out the sounds through track mutes, and keeping mind to make sure that each of the program versions was only playing one melody, and it worked well, but it did lead to a bit of a complicated mess of track mutes to work through the way I did it by recording track mutes in live. I did have to go to the list editor a few times to tweak the notes\u0026hellip; and holding shift saved my dang life to note have to adjust 960 values\u0026hellip; wooo.\nWith all of this settled\u0026hellip; although there was a bit of a bass sound, I decided to look for another section of the song to drop -24 semitones. What I came up with I liked, but it sorted of dropped in a bit jarringly at first. I ended up working out some automation to sweep the sound in\u0026hellip; which is a bit janky to some extent, but it worked much more effectively than what I had before that.\nThis lead to me taking the time to break the drum tracks into somewhat discrete parts so I could overdub in some track mutes for the drums.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;m pretty happy with how this all came out, but of course, there is always more room for improvement :D\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/02/14/mpcbb303-dream-in-a-music-box/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSubmission for \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40\u0026amp;t=210474\u0026amp;p=1825311#p1825311\"\u003eMPC Beat Battle 303\u003c/a\u003e over at MPC Forums.

Probably paid too much, but wanted to hook one up to my Akai S950, so there will be that, once I get the cable in.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve spent the last couple of days just playing around with it, reading the manual, and trying to get my brain around how it works. As you can see from the featured image, the interface is a bit sparse, and not a whole lot of direction as to what is going on.\nAbove, you can see that unlike the Akai S950, there\u0026rsquo;s not much in the way of knobs, and if you want to edit anything you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to be using the number pad or value slider a lot. Or do you? In my research on the Akai VX 90 I did find some smart people working on a customer firmware for the device the device in forum posts, but it was hard to tell if the work was done for the Akai VX 90, the AX 60, AX 73, or something else. Well\u0026hellip; with a little poking and searching on eBay, I was able to find something that NESYNTH was selling on eBay that was created by Tauntek, and it just showed up today. I took some pictures and figured I\u0026rsquo;d try and give a high level overview of how to upgrade the firmware yourself if you happened to want to try. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for what was documented check out the page A firmware update for the AKAI AX73 Synthesizer.\nBefore I get into the upgrade itself, the firmware opens up the option to using MIDI CC to assign your own controls to different parameters so that you can make changes with knobs, sliders, and buttons. This will definitely be much easier, and I figured it may also lead to some interesting control voltage to MIDI CC opportunities. It also allows for SYSEX dump backups, which I\u0026rsquo;ll also be looking into once I get settled in how the VX 90 works.\nAs is the style for other Akai systems of this time, you probably just need to remove two screws on each side, and one on the back in order to get the case off. The rack ears were included, but removed when shipped, and I currently have no reason to put them back on. In another month or two I am sure that will change, but for the time being they will remain off.\nBefore you get started, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to unplug the VX 90. These systems can hold an incredible amount of charge and just pass the power on to you. Don\u0026rsquo;t want to electrocute yourself, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to accidentally fry anything fragile here. Always remember to ground yourself, and it is not a bad habit to get into to just touch the metal on the case to help discharge any shocks you may have built up yourself.\nOnce you get the top off, you\u0026rsquo;ll see the guts of the synth. There isn\u0026rsquo;t too much going on with the boards really. The left side is mostly power and regulators, so nothing too fancy, the lower right board appears to be the 6 chips that provide the VCO voices and the upper right is two boards, the one on top that is brown is your audio output interface, and the lower board has the MIDI and (covered) the firmware that you\u0026rsquo;ll be replacing if you\u0026rsquo;re going to do this job.\nI took the picture above to show where the firmware actually sits. It\u0026rsquo;s not hard to get at, but you can see that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to take the top board off so that you can get at it and be able to replace it.\nIn the picture above, you can see I removed to screws, one on the middle back of the board, and one on the bottom middle of the board. You only need to remove the one on the bottom, and then the two black screws on the outside of the case that hold up the audio output for the board. The upper screw that I removed helps hold the PCB to the metal bracket on the audio out section (or at least I am pretty sure), and seems be unnecessary to remove.\nFrom here you can just flip the board over without having to remove all the cables and jacks, it\u0026rsquo;s a little bit tight and in the way, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t require having to pull the whole thing apart. One that is out of the way you can remove that metal mounting bracket that is covering the firmware.\nNow, for those of you that don\u0026rsquo;t know, look closely at the chip here. First it\u0026rsquo;s labelled Akai AX 73 v1.2A\u0026hellip; so yeah, this is literally the same system as the AX 73, just repackaged inside of the VX 90 rack mount. Second though, what I wanted to point out is you can see a notch in the white outline for the chip, this is showing you which direction the notch on your firmware should be when you install it. There is a tiny notch there on top if you look closely. Absolutely make sure that you line this up properly or you\u0026rsquo;re going to fry the chip. This old hardware definitely doesn\u0026rsquo;t have circuits to protect from putting chips in incorrectly, and it will result in burnt out chips and can negatively impact other components. Be careful, cautious, and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to double or triple check as you make these changes.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a picture of the replacement chip, still in the STATIC packaging to help protect it from shock. Again, electrical components are fragile\u0026hellip; make sure you are grounded properly. Touch the side of your case before handling components.\nThe picture above is just me checking to make sure the notches lined up the way I thought, and checking that it has the right number of pins. No sense going further unless it all looks right, which it does.\nTo get the firmware out, I just took my time with my Swiss army knife, using a flat bottle opener to slowly wiggle it out a little bit on each end at a time. You want to do this slowly and rather carefully because you don\u0026rsquo;t want to bend the pins. (NOTE: I did bend a couple pins a little, and was very careful to realign them properly in case I need to go back to the original firmware for any reason).\nAbove it me checking the alignment of the chip before I pushed it in. I took my time to make sure that the legs were all lined up and going to go into the IC socket. The first couple of times attempting to line it up they were on the outside of the socket, so again, just take your time and line it up. You really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to bend any of the pins, but do keep in mind that they may be out of alignment. Once you\u0026rsquo;re ready to push the chip in you want to apply a small amount of pressure across the top on both some so that it sets in straight and flat. This is the best way to make sure the pins don\u0026rsquo;t bend, and get a solid connection with the socket.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a picture of putting the whole shebang back together.\nEverything back together and powered on! Display actually has a valid output\u0026hellip; woot!\nSo yeah\u0026hellip; for now I\u0026rsquo;ll be using the headphone jack because there\u0026rsquo;s no (well not much) noise there\u0026hellip; I can at least make some sounds off of it and not getting a ground hum like I am off of the L/R outputs.\nGotta figure out what to tackle next, but it is nice to be able to use the q-links to modify CC parameters, will provide details on that next :D\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/02/11/akai-vx-90-firmware-upgrade/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been looking off and on for an Akai VX 90, and finally found one.

What are the advantages and do you use loopings for any music genre?\u0026rdquo;\nWhile I somewhat wonder if this is some form of spam, it is a good question (as I interpret it), and I figured I\u0026rsquo;d respond and it felt like a good topic for my blog to dig into a bit further.\nWhat is a Loop\nFor people just starting out in music, a loop is generally a piece of audio that can be played and will repeat (usually seamlessly) over and over again. You will frequently find things like drum loops, piano chords, bass lines, etc\u0026hellip; all recorded as different and unique sounds, and sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll find loops that combine all of these sounds together.\nYour browser does not support the audio element. However, there are a few important factors to consider about a loop. A loop will have a tempo/bpm, or in other words how fast or slow the content in the loop plays. This used to be very important to know because you often want to match the speed of two different loops so that they sound like they are playing together. With modern technology though it is much less of an issue, especially in software due to advances in time stretching algorithms which allow you to change the speed of a sound without affecting pitch.\nAnother important aspect of a loop, especially melodic content, is what is the scale or key of the loop, so that you can pick other sounds played in the same scale/key. If you do not do this, you can find yourself having inharmonic content playing that can sound off. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to say what is the right/wrong way to put sounds together, especially in this kind of a blog post, but it is something to either be aware of, or understand that you may want to learn more in this space at some point.\nWhy Use Loops\nThere are plenty of reasons to use loops in your music, and I would generally extend this to include drum kits, key groups, or other sample based content that you didn\u0026rsquo;t make yourself.\nA loop can help provide you with a rhythm or groove that you want to have in your song structure while you are just getting started. Plenty of people will take a drum loop for example, and just start jamming to it and recording their instrument. Later you can come back and remove the drum loop in favor of playing drums against your other recording to get a unique sounds, but that has been influenced by the tempo, swing, and overall feeling of the loop. Anybody who has been making music for any length of time has used this as a technique to help get the creative juices flowing.\nRelated to this idea, a loop can help get you some structure to your song so that you can focus on what you want to play yourself. In this case you may decide to keep the loop in your song, and then focus on playing the instrument that you are most comfortable with playing or want to practice. Loops will give you a consistent tempo to play against and can make for a diligent way to practice and be able to hear if you are playing on time or off time to the loop.\nSometimes you just want a certain feel or vibe, and you might not know how to make certain sounds yourself. A loop can be of any audio content, tone, texture, or type, and a loop pack that you like might have something extra special that adds character to your song. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using the loops that grab you and hold your attention.\nWhy Avoid Loops\nOn the other hand, there are also plenty of reasons to avoid loops, because there can be a lot of awful, poorly produced, or not clearly marked and identified content out there. This can lead to content that is not usable, useful, or otherwise is hard for people to leverage.\nThe biggest problem with using loops in your song is that it can lead to incredibly repetitive song structure. It makes it very easy to turn the music production process from thinking about what the producer wants and what the listener hears, into a process of just making a song that is loop on and loop off. This is absolutely a great way for new producers to start learning the ropes, but if you find yourself just building up song structures and sections by having a loop play and then not play, you will likely end up boring your audience.\nWhen using loops it is also difficult to change much of the audio content. Yes you can add filters and effects to change the sound, but once a loop is created you cannot often to back to the loop and add in a new piano note or drum hit. For a new producer, this can be frustrating because until you\u0026rsquo;ve developed the skills to know how to get around, you may find loops are more restrictive than you had initially thought.\nDepending on where you are in your journey of music product, one other thought I have is that the use of loops can impact your ability to publish content. If you intend to sell your songs on a music service, expect to be asked to provide licensing information, and this can be a real hassle, especially when you start to find out some licenses allow you to use samples in your songs, and others allow you to use the loops for personal use but require a separate agreement to publish your music.\nGoing Beyond Loops\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking to work with loops, but want to start getting into the next level, then I have a few suggestions.\nLearn multiple ways to chop up loops. This will allow you to change how the content is played, and depending on how you chop, can impart a more unique sound. One thing to note is that with all the graphical editors these days, it is still worth learning how to listen to a sound and chopping with your ears from time to time. I am always saying \u0026ldquo;if it sounds good, it is good\u0026rdquo;, and I mean it. Just because something is chopped to look visually pleasing doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you\u0026rsquo;ve got your best chop. Being sloppy with your chops can add some unique and special character. Especially if you\u0026rsquo;re using all the sounds that others are using.\nChopping up audio also can give it a bit of a cut short sound, and this is a core characteristic of some sample based music genres. Bits of silence, a little mistake hear and there, use your artistic license to know when it is good and when it might be taking something away from your music. There\u0026rsquo;s interesting things to experiment with, and having reverb tails cut short, or bleeding into the next chopped sample can give some very interesting atmosphere to your track.\nLearn to use effects, this can cover a lot of gaps and mistakes. For example, adding a little reverb to a sound can help flesh out a chopped up loop, and gives the new chops some room to breath. Reverb won\u0026rsquo;t cover every blemish, but it can be something to experiment with. Similarly, use a low pass filter on a drum loop to help isolate some of the bass drum sounds, you might like how it comes out.\nLook into software like Melodyne to determine notes/chords/scale of loops if you cannot do this by ear. Melodyne can take a loop and break it into parts so that you can see the notes that are being played, adjust them individually, as well as telling you what chords and scale are in. This can all be useful information to help you match loops with other loops or adjust a loop to fit with the track you are producing by keeping the tonality of the loop, but allowing it to fit within the broader context of the song.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/02/09/why-use-loops/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eNew MPC-Forums poster DCS created the post \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=18\u0026amp;t=210413\u0026amp;p=1824936#p1824936\"\u003eWHY LOOPINGS\u003c/a\u003e ~ \u0026ldquo;As an absolute beginner i would like to understand why loopings are used instead of tracks for beats.

In this post I will cover how to quickly get audio out of your iPad into your MPC, and get the MIDI connection over bluetooth to control/sequence the synthesizer on your iPad.\nIntroduction\nI recorded another video to go along with the post. If you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to follow step by step instructions I\u0026rsquo;ll also write them up after the video.\nhttps://youtu.be/BkjlWcGXtMo\nMPC Audio Input Setup\nBy default, when you boot up your MPC, it is not going to have monitoring turned on. For the MPC X, this is less of an issue in some ways, since it can do hardware monitoring, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to go over the steps necessary to enable software monitoring for your MPC so that you can get audio into it so you can sample.\nFrom the Main menu, a quick way to get to the Sampler is to do one of the following\nHold and press If configured, quickly double tap Press and then on the touch screen touch Hold and press \u0026lt;PAD 9\u0026gt; The last two options will work on any of the MPC Live/X/One models, and I know that there are shortcuts on the others. Personally, I frequently double tap , but YMMV for this option depending on which MPC model you have.\nAbove, you can see in the bottom left the button says \u0026ldquo;Off\u0026rdquo;. This is telling you that for the Input 1,2 that is selected in this case, that the monitoring is Off, and you will not be able to hear any of the audio. Go ahead and touch where it says \u0026ldquo;Off\u0026rdquo; to turn monitoring \u0026ldquo;On\u0026rdquo;.\nWith Monitoring \u0026ldquo;On\u0026rdquo;, you should be able to play any audio from your iPad (or any other device) that is hooked up to your MPC and hear sounds. If you don\u0026rsquo;t hear anything, then check the volume on your device, the gain setting you have on your MPC, and make sure that you have the appropriate cables to route audio into your MPC.\nNow, to be able to control your synthesizer you have loaded on your MPC, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to switch your Track to a MIDI track, that\u0026rsquo;s what I have selected in the middle of the screen to make sure I can send MIDI information out from the MPC. Unfortunately, where \u0026ldquo;MIDI PORT\u0026rdquo; is, it currently says , and if you scroll through your selections, you\u0026rsquo;re going to see that you\u0026rsquo;re probably not able to select your iPad as a target right now.\nConnecting your MPC Bluetooth MIDI to your iPad\nBefore we kick off into this section, if you have not done these steps to setup Bluetooth MIDI, then check out my post Akai MPC Live/X/One Bluetooth MIDI With an iPad. This will get you off the ground.\nAssuming you did follow my steps, and have powered off your devices, well this section is for getting you back into operation.\nHead over to your Bluetooth settings on your MPC, and you\u0026rsquo;re likely to see something like this. Unfortunately, no matter how many times you select your iPad and hit CONNECT on the touch screen, nothing is going to happen. For whatever reason (and I am sure there are several, I just don\u0026rsquo;t know them), you are not able to initiate a Bluetooth connection to your iPad from your MPC.\nInstead, head over to the Bluetooth settings on your iPad.\nAs you can see above, my MPC Live II is not connected, and to resolve this I just need to touch on the MPC Live II line to initiate the connection. So go ahead and do this now.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see a spinning icon, and hopefully this will end with a \u0026ldquo;Connected\u0026rdquo; displayed on the line.\nHeading back over to the MPC, you can confirm in the MPC Bluetooth settings that it is connected. We\u0026rsquo;re almost there!\nTo wrap things up, make sure you setup a MIDI track type, and select your iPad as the target MIDI PORT. Once this is done, and you have a synthesizer running on your iPad, you should be good to play instruments be able to hear them playing through your MPC and able to record them.\nConclussion and Notes\nThis is a really great way to be able to use your iPad as a synthesizer for your MPC. The iPad/iPhone apps have a world of great synths and sounds to draw from, so I encourage you to check things out over there.\nOne thing I do want to note though, is that I have found notes do get stuck from time to time, especially if you start running your iPad synthesizers in the background. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep playing around with this, but I just wanted you to know that if you have a problem with notes getting stuck, you may need to go through the process to kill the application on your iPad and then reload it.\nGood luck getting this setup for yourself, and as always have fun!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/02/08/akai-mpc-live-x-one-bluetooth-midi-and-ipad-synth/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI figured I\u0026rsquo;d do a quick video to build on my last post \u003ca href=\"/2021/02/03/akai-mpc-live-x-one-bluetooth-midi-with-an-ipad/\"\u003eAkai MPC Live/X/One Bluetooth MIDI With an iPad\u003c/a\u003e where I had describe how to get a Bluetooth MIDI connection working.

My goal was to publish a track to soundcloud, that no matter how good or bad, I was putting something up. Trust me, there are some stinkers up there, but I also managed to put some content up that I think sounds great and stands on its own pretty well!\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/sets/jamuary-2021\nI wrote up a blog post for each day, but I feel like now that a week has passed, it\u0026rsquo;s worth taking some time to reflect on what\u0026rsquo;s different for me having made a track a day (actually more due to a few Beat Battles and other Challenges), and where I feel like I am now musically.\nWhat has changed about me and my music production?\nI will tell you without a doubt, that pouring my time into a single piece of hardware, I feel like I know it so much better now. Sure there are many things I can still learn, but I am much closer to a comfort level with the MPC than I was before. When I started this, all I could think about was \u0026ldquo;boy I cannot wait for this to be over so I can get back to all the effects and instruments in my DAW\u0026rdquo;, and now I\u0026rsquo;m not so sure that is always the right answer. There\u0026rsquo;s a certain freedom from knowing your gear whether it is hardware or software better, and it helps reduce the impulse to go someplace else. For me this has helped me be more productive as a result, I am not struggling to reach for something comfortable, and its put me back into the mindset of thinking through my options to get around a problem and find a solution.\nI had become so used to Ableton Live as well, and doing micro edits and tweaks, and working in the MPC I do know you can dig under the covers there as well and get into the minutia\u0026hellip; but I\u0026rsquo;m also wondering if it really is worth the effort all the time to get everything to an exacting level of perfection. When you\u0026rsquo;re publishing a track a day, you really don\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury to tweak everything to be perfect, and there is a certain charm to leaving some rough edges. As an artist, it is always important to think about what mistakes are valuable and which ones you need to fix\u0026hellip; and I guess I was leaning into the mindset of driving towards perfection when working in the DAW. Again\u0026hellip; you can get to this level with the MPC as well for sure, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t afford myself the time for this, and I think it has rubbed off on my mentality.\nHow has producing a track a day changed my process?\nI mentioned this last month, but I\u0026rsquo;ll dig a little deeper. From the perspective of putting something out there regardless of how good or bad it is, it is a good process. It is important to remember what we may think is bad, somebody else may appreciate it. Assuming you are making art for yourself, what is the big deal anyways? Many of the tracks I have posted have single digit plays. Do I care how many plays I got? Nope! So right off the bat, just committing to getting something out gets you into the thinking of the life of the track, not just the fruition. You\u0026rsquo;ve got to consider how the parts join together, where do you put transitions, and most importantly what are you trying to accomplish for the day?\nSo over the last two months, I\u0026rsquo;ve definitely developed some tools and strategies to make quicker decisions. I am not going to spend forever looking for the perfect sample, and I\u0026rsquo;m not going to spend time to take a bad chop and work it into something that is decent. Either way can consume a lot of time, and building the muscles to know when it is time to move on is really important. I now have a much better idea of how much time spent coaxing something or trying to force something to work is good, and how much is bad.\nAnother thing to point out is that I am now *much* more happy to build up a bunch of parts of a song, and then just let the things that ultimately don\u0026rsquo;t fit in go to the way side and not get used. Previously I\u0026rsquo;d try and make everything I did count, and if I didn\u0026rsquo;t use something cool I\u0026rsquo;d try and move it to a place to get back to \u0026rsquo;later\u0026rsquo;. Guess what, those \u0026rsquo;later\u0026rsquo; moments rarely come, and when you do have the time, you now have a potential wasteland of half thoughts and ideas to sort through to try and find gold. Honestly, it\u0026rsquo;s not worth keeping mediocre ideas around for posterity, they just get in the way. Now to be clear, I am not saying toss all that stuff, but make sure you\u0026rsquo;re saving off gold for the future, and not just making yourself sift through rubbish.\nWould I do another track a day challenge for a month?\nOh absolutely! There were stressful times for sure, especially when my life and the challenge collided head on. I had evenings where I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the time to concentrate, or was distracted by something else. The key here is that I *wanted* to do this, so there are a few tracks I posted that were the barest bones of stems, but I did something, which was the critical part for me.\nI mentioned last month that I had frequently done prep work the night before to keep driving myself, and while I think it is a good option to consider, for this month, I didn\u0026rsquo;t do that as many times. Maybe two times this month versus about fifteen or twenty times last month. Did it save me? Possibly, but on the other hand I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, looking back now, it\u0026rsquo;s invigorating to have something you\u0026rsquo;re interested in carrying forward, but it\u0026rsquo;s a drag to be short on time, and then have to work on something you\u0026rsquo;re not all that excited for.\nAt the end of the day, it just made it that much more clear to focus on the things that you are passionate about. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing worse than getting to a project and having to slog through it. So\u0026hellip; my advice if you want to try a track a day challenge is to make the time when you\u0026rsquo;re into a track, and when you get a track that\u0026rsquo;s kind of meh\u0026hellip; just be cool with yourself to post something you know is kind of garbage. Accept it for what it is and move on, because not every day is going to be a winner. If it is, well you\u0026rsquo;re probably cheating yourself and not taking risks to learn new skills.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/02/06/reflection-on-jamuary2021-challenge/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo… like a lunatic, I just wrapped up two months in a row of making and publishing a track a day.  If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in what I did last month, go check out the \u003ca href=\"/2020/12/31/reflection-on-jamcember-2020-challenge/\"\u003e#jamcember2020\u003c/a\u003e post.

Still curious to explore and see new things, but not quite so bold as she once was.\nThe samples came out of the Loopmasters Tranquility set. It\u0026rsquo;s a trap kit, and I figured I\u0026rsquo;d grab it since I had picked up some other packs and had points or whatever\u0026hellip; so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I was going out of my way for\u0026hellip; but I also wanted to just check it out. I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like hunting and pecking for sounds this morning, but just wanted to lay something down. I *kind* of tried to find things that were in key, but then promptly did some transpositions and *shrug* I went for what seemed to sound good.\nTrack wise\u0026hellip;\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking to do anything fancy\u0026hellip; I just chopped up a drum sample and ignored that most of the sample existed. I mean\u0026hellip; guys\u0026hellip; you make a sample pack, and then create a drum loop for example that is 128 chops, but only has maybe 4-5 different sounds. Is this really necessary?! Honestly, it makes it feel like filler to me\u0026hellip; could\u0026rsquo;ve been a 2 bar loop instead of a monster 16 or 32 bar loop that just keeps repeating. At least put a filter sweep or something in there so that the sound changes a bit over time or across every few measures. Something to at least justify why it just keeps going on and on! At any rate\u0026hellip; I just settled on a pattern that repeated\u0026hellip; didn\u0026rsquo;t care to get fancy, and wanted to move myself out of my usual drum rhythms that I\u0026rsquo;ll tap out myself.\nThe chops were mostly straight forward as well. When chopping up the pianos I noticed some notes were chords, and some had some little flourishes to them, so once I chopped it up, I figured I would go into the pad color to only light up the pads I wanted to use. I considered trying to use some of the other notes, but the BPM was way off for what I was trying to put together.\nAs you can see above, I just lit up pad 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Mostly so I could make sure I didn\u0026rsquo;t accidentally use pads that had nothing on them or that I figured would sound bad in the track. Nothing too exciting honestly, but just helps keep you in the flow if you\u0026rsquo;re not committed to memorizing what is good/bad out of every chop. Spoiler alert, it\u0026rsquo;s not something I usually care to memorize :D\nFor both the Vox and the Strings I ended up duplicating the program (program pencil -\u0026gt; duplicate)\u0026hellip; but for two very different reasons.\nFor the Strings\u0026hellip; I wanted to have two different styles\u0026hellip; a more chopped but sustained sound, and a second almost scratching kind of rhythmic sound. Honestly, I could have done this with a single track, but I was having a bit of a problem when I muted the cut strings, and then moving the sustained sound that it was cutting the sustained sounds short. I suspect that even though the midi notes in the cut strings track were muted, somehow it was interacting with the sustained track notes. Not sure, didn\u0026rsquo;t care to dig deep, just duplicated that track and moved on.\nOn the other hand, the Vox program was a bit different. I did a region chop, and found I really dug the tail part of the Vox program a lot, but wanted the full Vox notes to also have the tail. Easy enough, just unlink the chop regions and then adjust the notes to fit. Effectively the Vox part was stretched to include the tail in the chop, and then the tail chop was just left as is. Since the tail was so much more quiet, I added the Enhancer effect which sounded great.\nOr rather, it sounded great until I figured I\u0026rsquo;d try moving to the YA Master setup. You see, once I moved into the YA Master, the Vox was crackling super fierce when the full sound would come in. I tried disabling the Enhancer, but this turned out to sound pretty bad still. What I clearly was going to do was change the mix levels on the Vox, but then this put the tail sections into a \u0026ldquo;too quiet to be useful\u0026rdquo;. There\u0026rsquo;s several ways I could have fixed this, but I decided the faster solution was just to duplicate the program, so that for the tail chops I could have the Enhancer effect on, and for the full Vox chops I could remove the enhancer and drop the track a bit lower in the mix. This was a much faster way to manage the problem than trying to remix everything, mess around with a compressor, or take each tail section and give it it\u0026rsquo;s own Enhancer plugin.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/02/06/track-right-in-the-kisser/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of funny\u0026hellip; because after doing the two months of making a track a day back to back\u0026hellip; I feel like my flow has transitioned to just putting stuff down in a different sort of way, making it a bit more raw\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/right-in-the-kisser\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/right-in-the-kisser\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe picture is from a few years back, when Amy was more of a spring chicken. she\u0026rsquo;s still quite an active dog, but she definitely prefers to be laying down on a lap, or being held.

You\u0026rsquo;ve at least got to give it a try! I kicked this video off from a post Dan B made over at MPC Forums Connecting iPad \u0026amp; EXT Midi Controllers to MPC Live\u0026hellip;\nIntroduction\nI just recorded a video to show how to setup Bluetooth Midi between an Akai MPC Live/X/One and an iPad. I have done these steps with an iPhone as well, and suspect that it would work just fine with plenty of other devices that support Midi over Bluetooth as well.\nhttps://youtu.be/BwwPZVgMoe4\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d prefer not to watch the video and want to watch the steps below, then feel free to follow along that way.\nMPC \u0026amp; iPad Bluetooth Setup\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start from your Main menu.\nFrom here, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to touch the House icon in the upper left to get into your options.\nFrom this menu touch the gear icon so that we can dig into your MPC\u0026rsquo;s Preferences.\nThe Preferences menu has a section for Bluetooth settings, so touch that.\nYou can see that in my Bluetooth preferences above, that Bluetooth was set to of, so go ahead and turn that on.\nWith Bluetooth turned on, it is going to start looking for both Paired Devices and Available Devices for it to connect to. Essentially Paired Devices are what you are able to connect when both devices are on, and Available Devices is what you have the option to pair with, but are not paired yet.\nIn my case above, nothing is available, so I need to power something on that can then I can make it available.\nAbove is the Home Screen of my iPad, and I\u0026rsquo;ll need to go to my iPad settings to get the other half of the Bluetooth pairing started. Assuming you have Bluetooth turned on for your iPad, once it is started, your MPC should be able to see it.\nHeading back to my MPC, I can now see the iPad is an Available device for my iPad to pair with. Go ahead and select your iPad and then touch the Pair button.\nOnce you have touched the Pair button on the MPC, you will see a popup request on your iPad, asking you if you would like to pair the two together.\nGo ahead and select Pair on your iPad. But do not that the MPC is going to tell you that this failed. It\u0026rsquo;s okay, we\u0026rsquo;ll fix it shortly.\nAbove, you can see on the iPad that it says the MPC Live II (in my case) is not connected, all you need to do is touch \u0026ldquo;Not Connected\u0026rdquo; on your iPad and it will connect.\nAnd viola, we now have a Bluetooth connection established between the iPad and the MPC! Now we can get some of the fun to begin.\nNavichord Setup\nHere you can see I loaded up Navichord, this is a great tool for playing out notes and chords!\nIf you touch the gear icon, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to open up the settings menu so that you can tell it to send midi notes out to your MPC. Go ahead and touch MIDI from the menu.\nNow this might be confusing, but with Navichord, do not go to the Bluetooth MIDI menu, this would seem obvious, but this is for specific types of Bluetooth MIDI devices\u0026hellip; which we\u0026rsquo;re not using in this example\u0026hellip; or at least the MPC does not meet those standards at this time. Instead you want to touch MIDI I/O.\nAbove you can see that in this case I only care about outputting notes to the MPC, and not at all interested in inputs. Definitely experiment, but if you\u0026rsquo;re only looking to play notes on the iPad to your MPC, then make sure the Outputs MPC Notes button is selected so that you can send notes from Navichord.\nChord Maps 2 Setup\nChord Maps 2 is another great application for playing Midi notes to your MPC.\nOnce you load it up, you have all kinds of options. This might look overwhelming as an application, and it kind of is, but it is really worth checking out. At any rate, to get yourself setup, click on the i icon in the upper left.\nAbove you see that the MPC Live II Bluetooth is a possible destination, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t enabled it yet. Let\u0026rsquo;s go ahead and do that.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve got a checkmark set, you\u0026rsquo;re now able to play notes from the iPad into your MPC. Just make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve got a key group loaded :)\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/02/03/akai-mpc-live-x-one-bluetooth-midi-with-an-ipad/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSetting up Midi over Bluetooth and the MPC is dead simple, and I figured I\u0026rsquo;d take some time to make a quick video and write this up for everybody else to enjoy.

This will answer a ton of questions for you, and gives some great exercises to work through if you are unfamiliar with the workflow, or have questions that the MPC 500 Manual doesn\u0026rsquo;t answer. And there are a lot of things that aren\u0026rsquo;t terribly clear in Akai\u0026rsquo;s MPC 500 Manual. Plus the Bible comes with some samples, so it will help get you off the ground and running.\nManual You can find the manual at the Akai Website under the Downloads section.\nMPC Tutor also has archived off a link for the Akai MPC 500 Manual, if you cannot get it elsewhere\u0026hellip; such as Akai\u0026rsquo;s website.\nYou might have to dig around a bit to find the Akai MPC 500 Service Manual, but hopefully that link will get you something if you are looking for information about the internals of the MPC 500.\nFirmware To check the version of firmware that you are running on your MPC 500, press \u0026lt;Pad 8 Other\u0026gt; and use the Data Wheel to scroll clockwise to \u0026ldquo;Version\u0026rdquo;. Firmware version 1.31 is the last version released for the MPC 500, and can be found at the Akai Website under the Downloads section. There\u0026rsquo;s also a handy set of release notes and manuals that you should check out while you are there. Some people swear by the 1.31 firmware, and others prefer older versions\u0026hellip; this is something worth doing some research about, and there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of topics to search through over at the MPC Forums MPC 500 sub forum if you interested enough to dig around.\nPower Supply If you\u0026rsquo;ve just bought an Akai MPC 500, chances are that you don\u0026rsquo;t have a power supply, or that you\u0026rsquo;ve got an after market power supply. You might be wondering what is okay, and what is not okay to use. First thing to note, and you can find this on the back of your MPC 500, is that the power supply specifications are 12 volt, and 500ma. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a 12v power supply that can output up to 2000ma, and it works just fine. You just want to make sure that you have the proper voltage\u0026hellip; and *at least* the minimum amperage for it to work properly. The specs for the Akai 500 allows for some small variance in voltage (so if you hit status and it reports 11.62v or so) it will also should work fine\u0026hellip; anyways\u0026hellip;\nA lot of people have been using the ones provided by MPC Stuff for quite some time\u0026hellip; so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sweat that too much if that is what you want to grab, though I do find the power supplies on MPC Stuff a bit pricey. The power supply that I purchased is from Amazon, and while it is a knockoff, you can check it out at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015SDLCCI\nMemory The memory slot is actually an old style laptop memory expansion. It is nothing fancy really, but if you only have the 16mb memory installed, you\u0026rsquo;re likely going to want to have 128mb instead, since it will free up far more sampling time for doing things that you\u0026rsquo;ll want to do. What you\u0026rsquo;re looking for specifically is PC 133, 144 Pin, CL3 SODIMM that is 256mb of memory. If that makes sense to you great, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t, just make sure you are searching for \u0026ldquo;PC 133 144PIN CL3 SODIMM 256MB\u0026rdquo;. It would be hard to point you in the right direction beyond that because there are so many manufacturers and things change in the tech space so fast. If you do have questions though, try heading over to MPC Forums MPC 500 sub forum and hopefully somebody can answer your questions.\nYou might be wondering if you\u0026rsquo;ve already got the memory upgrade installed. Power on your MPC 500 and press \u0026lt;Pad 4 Record\u0026gt;\u0026hellip; If you are on \u0026ldquo;Mode: Stereo\u0026rdquo; data wheel clockwise until you see \u0026ldquo;Free\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; this should read 12m02s if you have 128mb of memory, or if you are on \u0026ldquo;Mode: Mono L\u0026rdquo; data wheel clockwise until you see \u0026ldquo;Free\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; this should read 24m04s of memory\u0026hellip; this is assuming you have nothing loaded. It\u0026rsquo;s possible that the memory could be seen as 64mb\u0026hellip; 32mb\u0026hellip; or 16mb\u0026hellip; which would give you lower numbers in Free\u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know off hand what you would see for free sample time for lower amounts of memory.\nAs for a memory test on the MPC 500, I am not aware of one. You definitely could have stuck bits\u0026hellip; and this would cause weird behavior\u0026hellip; but it would entirely depend on where the issue was in memory to know what kind of behavior you\u0026rsquo;d get. Personally\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;d trust the memory\u0026hellip; but you could always record off a long sample and play it back to see how it sounds\u0026hellip; but given you\u0026rsquo;re looking at 23 minutes of listening\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not sure you\u0026rsquo;d do anything beyond hoping to get lucky to find something odd.\nStorage The MPC 500 uses compact flash as the way it loads and saves the majority of the data. I believe that the manual states that it supports up to a 2GB sized compact flash card, but I have used up to a 256GB compact flash card with no issues before. The important thing to know is that you will need to format the drive as FAT32, but beyond that it should be relatively straight forward to get things working on the MPC 500. Honestly though, with such a small screen, and limited sample memory, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t suggest going crazy with a large Compact Flash card to start, just make sure you get a CF Type I or CF Type II card, and you should be all set.\nI will note that some users have moved to purchasing a CF to SD card adaptor, and while I understand the interest in this space to avoid needing a CF card reader on the PC side, I\u0026rsquo;d personally avoid it. While it may be convenient, inserting and removing the CF card on your MPC 500 risks bending a pin in the CF card reader area, and once bent, it is quite expensive to repair. You\u0026rsquo;re likely better off to use the USB port to hook up your MPC to your computer. While slower since it is a USB 1.x connection, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t run the risk of breaking the MPC 500 in a way that is expensive to repair. Or you know\u0026hellip; just be gentle when inserting your CF card.\nNote: Memory \u0026amp; Storage There\u0026rsquo;s plenty of good resource information on MPC Forums, and in particular if you\u0026rsquo;re curious to see what works I would start with the thread MPC1000 RAM AND CF CARD RECOMMENDATIONS. Although this is technically for the MPC 1000, the 500 and 1000 (and 2500) share the same platform, so what works for one will work for the other.\nDisplay Contrast The display on the MPC 500 is an LED display, and the contrast adjusts the angle that you can view the display\u0026hellip; this may sound odd compared to how newer display technology works, but that\u0026rsquo;s how this old technology is.\nThe display contrast is a screw that is located in the battery compartment. You can read about it on page 5 of the manual, and it explains a bit more about the knob. If you want to skip the manual though, here is the excerpt:\n2. [Contrast] Adjustment: Inside the battery compartment is a contrast adjust for the LCD display. This will be able to accommodate several different viewing angles. The [CONTRAST] adjustment can be changed by using a standard Phillips head screwdriver.\n\\\\\\* CAUTION! ***\nThis screw is a knob, which should move easily. It does not tighten like a standard screw. If the screw stops turning, DO NOT tighten it beyond this point. This could result in damage, which will require factory service.\n~ Akai MPC 500 Manual 1.0, page 5\nJust be careful and do not force anything\u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;ll be good.\nBatteries The MPC 500 takes six standard AA batteries. I\u0026rsquo;ve used rechargeable batteries in the past, and they work fine, but do have a lower capacity than the highest end AA batteries you can find. It\u0026rsquo;s a reasonable way to get the MPC 500 out of the house and go do some work on the road or outside.\nOne warning though, those batteries can move around, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re knocking the pads real hard. This can be frustrating because it can turn off or lock up your MPC 500, and mess up all of your hard work. If you find this happening a lot, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely want to replace the foam material that helps hold the batteries in tight. I\u0026rsquo;ve also used tape to hold them in better to good effect, but the foam really does most of the job to hold the connection.\nNote: One oddity that I have observed using rechargeable batteries with the MPC 500 in the past was that they would effectively trickle charge overnight if I left them in while the MPC 500 was plugged in. At first this might sound great, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use this as an alternative charging mechanism. The MPC 500 is not meant to charge batteries, and the regular circuits in place to properly charge them to full, monitor for overheating, and all the other safety measures will be non existent. I would avoid plugging in the MPC 500 for extended periods of time with any batteries in it just to be safe.\nMounting USB So\u0026hellip; you want to hook the MPC 500 up to your computer over USB. Good on you! Just be prepared, this is going to be slower than you\u0026rsquo;re likely used to, so be patient. To get into USB Mode, press \u0026lt;Pad 2 Load\u0026gt; and turn the Data Wheel clockwise to \u0026ldquo;USB\u0026rdquo;. This will read \u0026ldquo;Not Connected\u0026rdquo; until you hook up the cable to your MPC 500 and your computer. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve connected both ends it will read \u0026ldquo;Connected\u0026rdquo; and will immediately mount the CF card onto your computer.\nNOTE: Before proceeding, you should make sure that you unmount your MPC 500 driver properly before you disconnect the USB cable, otherwise you risk corrupting the files and filesystem on the CF Card.\nOnce connected, you can copy files to and from your CF card and your computer to do things like backup projects, add new files to your MPC 500, and all that fun stuff. When you are done, eject your Compact Flash card from your MPC. If you end up having problems ejecting the card, your best bet may be to shutdown your computer before you proceed in disconnecting the MPC 500 to ensure that it is unmounted properly.\nPersonally, I have had problems unmounting the card from my OS X system, and it seems waiting while the computer \u0026ldquo;does it\u0026rsquo;s thing\u0026rdquo; helps. I suspect that the computer was looking through all the files to see what it had mounted, but since the connection is so slow over USB 1.x, that it just needed a lot of time. At any rate, it is worth noting that even when you have unmounted the drive the display on the MPC 500 will continue to say \u0026ldquo;Connected\u0026rdquo;, even though it is no longer mounted. As long as you no longer see the drive mounted in your computer it should be safe to disconnect at this point and you should see the display change back to \u0026ldquo;Not connected\u0026rdquo;.\nInternal Samples If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for the factory internal sounds\u0026hellip; see what setting you have for auto load. \u0026lt;Pad 2 Load\u0026gt;\u0026hellip; right arrow over to \u0026ldquo;Program\u0026rdquo; then data wheel clockwise to \u0026ldquo;Autoload\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; if you down arrow you can change OFF/ON. Personally\u0026hellip; these sounds are just \u0026ldquo;okay\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; but if you just want to see what is there they it\u0026rsquo;s a good place to start.\nTo free up your sample memory again, just run the procedure to set Autoload to OFF, and then it will not load any of the content from startup again. I have had a problem ejecting the MPC 500 on my computer, and if you have a similar problem ejecting because the computer keeps mounting or maintaining the drive without letting it go, your best bet is to turn off your computer so that it can safely unmount the storage as part of the shutdown procedure.\nSamples The MPC 500 supports the .wav file format, with 16-bit depth and a 44.1khz sampling rate for both mono and stereo samples. The MPC 500 may be able to handle a few other formats, but this is what you are going to want to work with 99.9% of the time. If you do not know how your samples are formatted, get software such as Audacity (it is free and open source\u0026hellip; so you don\u0026rsquo;t need much of anything special to use it), and you can use the software to both determine what format a file is in, as well as exporting files to the proper format for the MPC 500.\nOutput Volume One thing you are likely to notice once you play around with the sounds is how much louder it sounds compared to anything you sample in\u0026hellip; so a few things to note:\n\\* It has the compressor on \u0026lt;Pad 9 Effect\u0026gt; Data wheel clockwise to Master : Comp\u0026hellip; you can check settings here, but this will give a bit more oomph\n\\* It has all program levels set to 100 (versus the default assignment of 70)\u0026hellip; so \u0026lt;Pad 6 Program\u0026gt; Data wheel clockwise to Sample level and adjust\nWhile you\u0026rsquo;re digging around\u0026hellip; you should go to \u0026lt;Pad 8 Other\u0026gt; and see what your \u0026ldquo;Master Level\u0026rdquo; is set to\u0026hellip; for maximum loudness\u0026hellip; you\u0026rsquo;ll want to set this to 0db\u0026hellip; but you will run the risk of digital distortion and clipping your audio\u0026hellip; so likely you\u0026rsquo;ll want to go to -6db or -12db depending on how you work. At least remember it is there so if you hear everything going wonky you can change it.\nPad Sensitivity The pads on the MPC 500 are not great\u0026hellip; so you might look up the electrical tape fix\u0026hellip; basically some folks put tape on the button of the pads to fill the gap between the pads and the sensors\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s an okay fix\u0026hellip; and you can tell if you want it based on if you can slowly push the pad down\u0026hellip; some of them may have as much as a half millimeter of play\u0026hellip; this is something you can search around on MPC Forums for, or check out MPC Stuff to get thicker pads that don\u0026rsquo;t have such a large gap to help improve sensitivity (the fat pads in particular).\nYou can also adjust how the software handles pad sensitivity by pressing \u0026lt;Pad 8 Other\u0026gt;, and Data Wheel to \u0026ldquo;Pad Sensitivity\u0026rdquo;. You can look up all kinds of charts for this, but personally I\u0026rsquo;d stick with the same setting for each pad. Also\u0026hellip; you have to adjust each pad, so if you make a change to one pad, you have only effected that one pad, not all of them. So for \u0026ldquo;PAD1\u0026rdquo; through \u0026ldquo;PAD12\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; go through to make your change. Personally I\u0026rsquo;ve just settled on 16 (max) and Curve:A for the time being\u0026hellip; but definitely feel free to experiment. The value from 1 to 16 sets what amount of velocity gets output from a pad tap\u0026hellip; so the value of 1, effectively means that a harder hit is necessary to product a max velocity of 127, while a value of 16 means a softer hit will produce a max velocity of 127.\nFull Level and 12 Levels Don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to mix using Full Level so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to hammer on the pads so hard\u0026hellip; and/or 12 Levels\u0026hellip; 12 Levels Velocity will get you a lot more play in changing up notes without having to engineer a fix for the pads/sensors while you get a feel for the box.\nNoise Floor Like any device that operates in the analogue realm, you\u0026rsquo;re going to get some noise. Hopefully it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother you too much\u0026hellip; or you like the grit. I will note though, that the MPC 500 is known for having used some rather poor capacitors, especially in the part of the device dedicated to keeping the noise lower\u0026hellip; so you might want to check out the MPC Forums thread NOISY MPC500? LOOK NO FURTHER. If you\u0026rsquo;re up for soldering work, you may just be able to clean up some noise and get a better signal. Be warned, if you don\u0026rsquo;t know how to desolder or solder, while not terribly difficult to fix, you also run the risk of burning the board, yourself, or otherwise breaking the MPC 500. So check it out\u0026hellip; but this probably isn\u0026rsquo;t a project to learn soldering techniques.\nRepair I\u0026rsquo;ve been through a few MPC 500\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; and maintenance is something you\u0026rsquo;ve got to keep up with, especially as they get older. It has especially been some work on fixing an MPC 500 on Reverb that I purchased last year.\nThe MPC booted up just fine, but boy was it bunged up. I documented the repairs I had to do for the Q-Link slider board at Akai MPC 500 Repair. I did some general cleanup in the post Akai MPC 500 Tact Switches.\nAnyways\u0026hellip; good luck and have fun!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/01/18/so-you-just-bought-an-akai-mpc-500-what-next/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"mpc-bible\"\u003eMPC Bible\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI will absolutely, highly, emphatically\u0026hellip; suggest checking out (i.e. purchasing) MPC Tutor\u0026rsquo;s excellent \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-samples.com/product.php/104/beat-making-on-the-mpc500/\"\u003eBeat Making on the MPC500\u003c/a\u003e.

Well\u0026hellip; I wanted to try to do some production on a different machine\u0026hellip; and figured I\u0026rsquo;d dig up my MPC 500.

From here I was trying to remember how to extend a sequence from 2 bars to a 4 bar or 8 bar loop\u0026hellip; and then how to copy tracks, explode notes, whatever\u0026hellip; and just remembered that I used to have the muscle memory for the MPC 500, but have definitely lost it.\nI certainly had fun\u0026hellip; but wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to make of a 4 bar loop. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to sample it all back into the Live because I didn\u0026rsquo;t have time, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to brute force my way to something bad. So I just tried to kick start/stop a few sections, and boy was that brutal\u0026hellip; Play Start on the MPC 500 does not work the way it does on other MPCs as I remember.

I figured that way I\u0026rsquo;m not having drums hop all over the place and can have some more control over what is going on. It was a little bit more work, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t insurmountable.\nGetting through that, I figured I would blast out the track and then work through exploding the drums, adding track mutes, and then adding in some other drum components to add in a bit more flair to the track and keep it moving. I\u0026rsquo;m not totally convinced I am in love with the process, but it does add a little bit of an element of helping keep things changing and moving in a way that just copying sequence to sequence doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow for. For real, this is something that I suspect just takes more practice and dedication, and the reason it feels wonky is more because I am doing a track a day and just keep pushing forward than necessarily having anything to do with the process.\nWith all that said, I\u0026rsquo;m still kicking the tires on audio track recording as well, and I think I am getting a bit of a better workflow here as well. I have moved to recording off programs as I see fit for audio coming in from the Virus or Iridium that is a good candidate to turn into a program, and things that are more longer or evolving sounds I am waiting to track out at the very end as a audio track. This is helping keep things a bit more coherent and keeping them moving for me, but importing audio tracks into YAM is still a bit of a hassle. On the plus side, it\u0026rsquo;s really coming down to only fidgeting with a couple of audio tracks now (for the length of the full sequence that was converted from a song), rather than having to get fiddly with a whole mess of shorter stems. I can see it working, and perhaps I should be considering just doing the stem/audio track recording process after I have imported everything into YAM. Will have to think on that.\nAs for the key groups I made today, check out below:\nNT Key Groups 2021-01-09 Download\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2021/01/09/jamuary2021-long-voyage/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAlright back again messing with TraTraTra Transpose!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/long-voyage\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/long-voyage\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoy, the picture is from about four years ago\u0026hellip; Amy is looking impressively squinty\u0026hellip; might have been from the flash, I don\u0026rsquo;t really recall.

Personally I would say this is ridiculous\u0026hellip; and it kind of is to do this for a drum map, but on the other hand I suppose I could see some interesting side effects to take advantage of such behavior to try and make some new drum patterns.

As another experiment, I\u0026rsquo;d say it worked okay\u0026hellip; but I felt like I was fighting the interface a lot. Not just from the above\u0026hellip; but I had plenty of notes across the range from C-1 to C-8 or so, and while in grid view and switching tracks, it kept moving the view finder. It would be most excellent if the grid view would remember what range of notes you were last editing, because while I didn\u0026rsquo;t mind changing tracks to edit notes and placements and all, what I did mind was having to change to the magnifying glass tool, zip around to look at what I wanted to see, and then change tracks to realize I had forgotten where I was. Copious notes might help here while doing editing, but it definitely made me feel like I was fighting the machine in a way that I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt in a while. Working in one large sequence was freeing in one way, but it seems that the grid view and editing in general is a side effect of this, and the device isn\u0026rsquo;t really tailored towards working on such long passages. I can live with it for sure, and it will probably lead me back down the path of working with multiple sequences, but there is a certain spontaneity that I feel I was getting working on a single sequence that I haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten hammering on a bunch of different sequencer sections.\nAll that said, I am still quite happy continuing to work just in the MPC interface, and I suspect there are further workflow changes I can make to help streamline the music creation process. I\u0026rsquo;m taking this month as an opportunity to keep building on things I learned from last month, and may end up ejecting into a different production device, or software at some point, just to round myself back out a bit more.

She is by no means intimidating, and is actually one of the sweetest dogs you could find, but this picture does make her look a little haunted.\nFor putting this track together I stuck with the old faithful Akai MPC Live mk2, but really started by recording off some midi tracks using both the Access Virus TI2 Darkstar and Waldorf Iridium to create some ambient sounds. The Virus took the mid range and high parts of the ambient pads, and I put the Iridium on duties for the low end rumbling sounds. I had to tighten up the Iridium with some filtering and give the Virus\u0026rsquo; high end pads some more space. The MPC Live took drum and sequencer duties to help coordinate everything, and I just put the song together entirely in Song mode.

My goal was to do all of the production on the MPC Live mk2, and just push content to a coherent enough thought or conclusion without necessarily worrying about all of the bells and whistles. Sampling sources, expansion packs, completing old incomplete tracks, that was all on the table for me throughout December.\nHere are all of the tracks that I put together:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/sets/jamcember-2020\nI tried to write up a blog post for each day, and attached it to each track. Some days I provided a bit more detail than others, but overall there\u0026rsquo;s some level of detail for each track there or in the blog if you are interested. Instead, I wanted to put this post together to put down some thoughts about why I did this, what I wanted to accomplish, lessons learned, and what I might do differently in the future, and suggestions for others who might take a similar challenge.\nWhy Make a Track a Day? For starters, I was looking to do something different to push myself outside of my musical comfort zone. The hundreds of directories of half started projects on my MPC Live alone can attest to that. Quite a bit of this old content is suspect, and probably doesn\u0026rsquo;t warrant completion, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a fair bit of projects that aren\u0026rsquo;t too bad and just needed a push to put them into some kind of song structure.\nThere is also an appeal to just constantly fiddling with a track to make it \u0026lsquo;perfect\u0026rsquo; when it is well passed done and at least for me, I start making it worse. Usually this is where working with another person can help because they can talk some sense into me, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t find anybody who was particularly interested in trying to bounce MPC Projects around and get a track done a day. I get it, there\u0026rsquo;s certainly a commitment level there that is hard to coordinate cooperation on. So this became a solo show, and was something I wanted to spend one to two hours a day on.\nFinally, I have fallen into some bad habits, nothing serious mind you, but milling through web pages, watching nonsense YouTube videos, playing video games, well\u0026hellip; it can eat up a lot of time and you have nothing to show for it. I figured I could easily pull back an hour a day from my time and get myself more focussed on something creative and no matter how good or bad, just putting it out into the universe.\nWhat Did I Learn Making a Track a Day? Possibly the most important thing that I learned was that I can do it, period. It seemed like a daunting task at the start, and I did consider just throwing in the towel near the end, but there\u0026rsquo;s also a certain reward in just completing something you set out to do that you never quite get if you\u0026rsquo;re willing to say \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo;. Plus, it isn\u0026rsquo;t like I was aiming for perfection, it was more an act of just doing something, anything.\nPutting a track down, you can actually do an awful lot on the MPC in an hour. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t suggest that you can get a properly finished track, though I do feel that a few I did are super close, but it is entirely possible to get a near complete idea down. Now I know I say this and I skipped tons of mechanical bits intentionally, but having a game plan is very important when doing this. For me, I had the safety net of incomplete tracks to lean on and scramble together, so I was not worried that I would have a lack of content, just a possible lack of drive and will of character.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also going to state for a fact, that after going through thirty one tracks, it is clearly entirely possible for somebody to do an entire production on the MPC Live nearly from start to finish. Between the synths, fx, and inputs, you can really put together something solid. From time to time people throw mud at the MPC Live, and while some of it is warranted, this is still a beast of a machine and absolutely a worthy successor to previous pedigree MPCs. It isn\u0026rsquo;t going to work magic, so garbage in is garbage out\u0026hellip; as can be seen from some of the tracks I made :D\nI will end on the fact that there is a certain freedom of just doing a track a day and being able to give a problem the middle finger and move on. There are tons of warts on the daily tracks I have done, but also feels impressive to have knocked them out at all. Usually I take a week or two to get a track done, and looking back, if I\u0026rsquo;m honest\u0026hellip; a number of them didn\u0026rsquo;t have that much more to show for putting in what probably amounts to an extra hour or two. I was able to set aside around fifty or sixty hours for the month and I\u0026rsquo;m allowing myself to be proud about that.\nWhat Would I Change? Oh boy, I suppose getting more hours in a day would be tough\u0026hellip; or at least adding more hours to a 24 hour day, and getting 25 or 26. Yeah no, that\u0026rsquo;s not happening.\nFor me, I had a pretty good idea that I could set aside an hour to two a day on average. This meant for me that if I had a good run on a track, and still had an hour left, I considered prepping for the next day. This was especially handy on a few days where we had holiday stuff going on and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure that I was going to have enough sober time to think properly and get a track wrapped up with a bow on it. Predominantly I did most of the work on the day of though, so it worked out quite well. If I did this in the future, I do think I would be more conscious of prepping for a day, or possibly taking every few days to prepare for a three day chunk at a time.\nI have the MPC Live, and it is portable, I do feel like I should have taken advantage of different locations. At the very least instead of sitting in the same room in the house, just move to someplace different for a change of scenery. It could have given me some different perspective and something to focus on in addition to the music.\nLooking back I would have liked to get a bit more closed loop feedback. I could have asked family members what they thought and possibly tweaked some of the tracks a bit. There is however a bit of a double edged sword though in that it is possible that getting the feedback would have been too time consuming to address and would have pushed me into not wanting to complete this exercise. Maybe know yourself and who you are getting feedback from, so that you know if it is valuable to take in or not.\nAny Suggestions For the Future? Probably my biggest suggestion for somebody who wanted to attempt a track a day, no matter the platform would be to have a pretty good understanding of your gear. You\u0026rsquo;re not going to have too much time to experiment or dig through the manual, instead you\u0026rsquo;ll want to be laser focussed on the easy stuff, and know how to get yourself out of the mud if you get stuck.\nWhen you do want to play around, be very thoughtful about how much time you want to experiment or try new processes and techniques. If it is working then great, but if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, just know when it is time to abort. One thing I was doing to keep myself sane was just plugging out the basics for a track frequently so I could at least have a scaffold to build around, kind of like giving myself the playground to work on.\nThis goes for life in general, but I also found myself having to know how to balance a proper level of commitment to content I made, so that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t over committed because I invested too much time in something that wasn\u0026rsquo;t working, but also not under committing and not developing an idea enough. Honestly, for a track a day, you\u0026rsquo;ll be under committing a *lot* (especially if you also have a family, job, and other commitments), but there is a danger in either\u0026hellip; so just pay attention to yourself and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to be self reflective.\nSpeaking of self reflection, for me personally, I had a very loose roadmap of what I wanted to do between completing tracks, pushing the MPC, messing with canned loops, producing my own content, and that roughly fell out into about one week long chunks. This was something I did subconsciously though, and just had a feeling it was time to move on and try something different, rather than having written it down on the calendar. I bounced around here and there, but overall, whatever you set out to do, I suggest having a game plan so when you get bored you have a good idea what to move on to, or go back to, so you\u0026rsquo;re not struggling to determine what to do for the day.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/12/31/reflection-on-jamcember-2020-challenge/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, I just wrapped up putting together a track a day, no matter how good or bad, and posting *something* daily over the month of December.

Today I just needed to go for sound design someplace else.\nTo get this track really rocking I spent a lot of time just working on sound design in the Akai S950, and running the output through some Chase Bliss Audio guitar pedals.

I made my choice and decided to move on.\nI also wanted to go for more of an older school style track similar to what I used to throw together. Get a sound I liked, lean into it to the extreme, and just build around it into this (often obnoxiously so) long DJ style track.

The result is that those old beat up Orchestral Strings from the S950 and abused through the Generation Loss probably outstay their welcome, but isn\u0026rsquo;t that half the point of a good old time track.

First, I made four bar loops, but extended them out to eight bars, because I wanted the ambience to flow through to the start of the first bar, instead of hearing the loop in the first bar kind of catch up. Something sounds a bit off\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s possible that I have an LFO that is not sync\u0026rsquo;d to the track, or maybe my copy/paste of notes was bad. I tried it\u0026hellip; and while it didn\u0026rsquo;t work quite how I wanted, well\u0026hellip; it still produced results.\nOnce I chopped up the loops, I spent some time in Program mode this time trying to adjust the ADSR to eliminate chops without having to find 0 points for every slice. This had varying success\u0026hellip; but quickly makes the cuts sound like they are being volume gated, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t really the sound I was going for. I *think* I could have solved this a bit by switching the drum kits from mono to a polyphonic sound, but I kind of gave up on fixing it in this track because at the end of the day, it didn\u0026rsquo;t really matter that much to me.\nThe second thing I did was once I had the song exported back out as a sequence, I spent some time adding in some extra notes and flourishes.

Made for some surprising tracks, and made it a bit more difficult (or impossible) to line things up the way I wanted\u0026hellip; but I figured it was time to change how I was approaching the tracks.\nI suppose on the plus side, putting this track together was quite fast, because in many ways I just could not, would not, or just wasn\u0026rsquo;t interested in puzzling my way through some problems based on how I approached the track. Oh yeah, all the programs were mono so I could flip out on the pads a bit more\u0026hellip; but this also meant that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t play two drums at the same time from the same sample.

Well a few minutes after dropping Hello Sputnik, Sunbeam42 on Soundcloud dropped a note about cutting out the noise. I figured I had the time so why not just make a Goodbye Sputnik track and see how it went.

What I settled on is fine, but I think it could have been a bit bigger to compete with some of the sounds that really pushed the drums backwards. I also suspect that Mother Ducker could have done some work for me to pump the bass, or I needed some eq/filter to make a bit more room for the kicks.\nEither way, I\u0026rsquo;m actually pretty impressed with how much you can do with just the included synths, and I suspect through gratuitous resampling and chopping a person would be able to make some very interesting tracks.

I squirreled through a bunch of samples, pitching things around, and ended up adding that kind of glitchy sample that kicks off the intro and warbles in a kind of weird way. That helped, but it felt like it still needed some atmosphere.

I was going to work on some change ups, get some additional sound sampled in there, all that good stuff\u0026hellip; but then I figured I\u0026rsquo;d see what I could do with the sounds in there.

I am quite certain I\u0026rsquo;ve hit this issue before, and just didn\u0026rsquo;t pay it any mind.

I started this little number about two weeks ago\u0026hellip; just before I wanted to try and put out a track a week.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/powerful-feeling\nThe picture is\u0026hellip; probably eight years old now? There were some monks making mandalas in my home town and I have some interesting videos of the work they did. The level of concentration is impressive to put together these images, and you can see they are using masks to make sure the do not disturb the sand while they are making the picture. It\u0026rsquo;s a pretty cool process, and it was fun to watch. My daughter got a kick out of it, and I have a video where one of the monks helped her make her own tiny image out of sand.\nBack to the track. The drum break is actually what I used to do my S950 to S1000 test a few weeks back. Maybe two weeks now? I forget, and am being too lazy to go look it up. At any rate, I played around with the break a bit to adjust the timing, and did some small amount to flip it in a few places for the track, but honestly nothing too serious. It felt like it was really lacking some high hats, so I added that in, and kind of got this chord vibe going, with a slapping bass sample.\nFrom what I had put together, I figured it wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite enough to really make a track out of, so I dug out some piano and a kind of weird Pad FX sample. Which I subsequently went to town by filtering, especially the Pad FX, which I turned into this odd kind of chant sound using the built in Akai FX. The piano, well\u0026hellip; I automated a slow HP filter sweep on it through the middle to the end of it playing, and had it slowly finish out with some Akai FX tape delay to add some Wow and Flutter. It\u0026rsquo;s passable in the mix, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound quite so great on it\u0026rsquo;s own.\nBeyond that, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t too stoked to do a bunch of builds, drops, and main sections, so I just decided to build off of five 8 bar loops, and make a track out of it. Listening back, the track kind of suffers from this because some of the sections are a bit more repetitive than they should be, and worse, there isn\u0026rsquo;t really much to add any kind of tension or movement in the track. It drives forward in a way, but there\u0026rsquo;s just too much time between anything interesting happening. If I ever went back to this track I\u0026rsquo;ll have to remember that it needs a riser or reverse crash or something to also help with transitions. The track isn\u0026rsquo;t asking for much\u0026hellip; but as it stands it feels kind of like an over all dud even if I do really like different parts of the track.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/12/06/jamcember-powerful-feeling/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to day numero six.

So long sort of interesting tree and wild\u0026hellip; what is that\u0026hellip; a sunset?\nThe track itself is something that my notes tell me I kicked off a little over a month ago. Honestly, I\u0026rsquo;ve toyed with trying to complete it as a track a handful of times, and really wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with how it was coming out. Given the month of pushing through completing tracks though it felt like something that I could get behind. I liked it just enough, and it required quite a bit of work\u0026hellip; so why not?!\nWhere I think this track falls down a bit for me and why it is a bit disjointed is because not all the bits quite fit together. I probably could have re-recorded some of the track sections to get a different vibe, but I kind of dig the vibe, and perhaps its just the tone(s) that needed some tuning to sit better with each other.\nOne thing that was painfully obvious once I really started tracking out was I had done a really poor job chopping. Lazy chopping definitely made me lazy here, and really contributed to some of the initial poor sound. Tails on chops would spike, or lead into the next sound, and while it wasn\u0026rsquo;t noticeable in the main and chorus type sections, it was painfully obvious how bad they were in the drops, intros, and outros. Sticking to the laziness, I was going to just post the track as is without fixing it, but as soon as I ran it through a YA Mastering round\u0026hellip; well *oof* it was so much worse. The compression really grabbed onto those transients and made them so painful to hear that I had to fix it before releasing the track.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll wrap up today by saying yeah\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s fine to be lazy and all, especially when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to hammer through tracks one or more a day, but I suppose don\u0026rsquo;t let your laziness get the best of you to produce a really poor product. There\u0026rsquo;s a difference between being efficiently lazy, and just disgustingly lazy. While I\u0026rsquo;m not stoked with how this track came out\u0026hellip; I at least pushed it away from the disgustingly lazy more than it had been.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/12/05/jamcember-from-left-field/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s day five already\u0026hellip; and I pulled together another track.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/from-left-field\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/from-left-field\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe painting is a water color that I did years ago\u0026hellip; probably over fifteen years ago.

We got into details about how the S900/S950 worked, which then lead into S900/S950 samples sounding more full on the S1000 and later. I ended up taking a stab at sampling both white noise and a drum break on the S950 with a bandwidth of 3000 and 19200, and then playing the notes across the key group to get some samples together. Below is the project and recordings from the S950 and S1000 for your own listening.\nS950 S1000 - Noise and Drum Comparison Download\nIn this project you\u0026rsquo;ll find two files that start with \u0026ldquo;Original\u0026rdquo;, these are the original white noise and drum break files that I played out from the MPC Live into the S950 to record. I recorded both two times into the S950 at both a bandwidth of 3000 and 19200. These are just saved as generic tone programs, but I\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded these as well in case you\u0026rsquo;ve got a device with a USB reader that can manage .hfe files, or if you have a way to load them onto a floppy disk. These files are below.\nS950 S1000 - Noise and Drum Comparison Download\nFor all of the key groups/samples, C3 is the original sample recorded, and I tried to time stretch the content up and down from C0 to C5. However, things got a little fiddly, especially on the S1000, it didn\u0026rsquo;t want to stretch the sample down so far. I\u0026rsquo;m not terribly sure why, might be a program issue with the key group, or perhaps the S1000 cannot stretch a sample down so far. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to poke at it a bit more. If I decided to do more comparisons for a single sample, I think I will go C1 to C4 next time. The auto sampler was a stride of 4, so it\u0026rsquo;s not a one to one for every semi tone stretch, but plenty of the samples here you can straight compare.\nNow, with all of that out of the way, you can listen to the samples for yourself. Either check out the exact samples, or go to Track 3 and swap between two of the programs. You can definitely hear that the S1000 does something differently with the samples that the high end is a bit more audible. I suspect that the S950 has some form of non resonant low pass filter, but it is also possible that the algorithms for converting the S950 program to an S1000 program does something fancy to anti-alias or otherwise transform the samples to 16-bit that just makes it sound a bit better. Honestly I am not sure, but clearly if you want a bit more high end from those old 12 bit samples you\u0026rsquo;ll want to try the samples out on the S1000. I have no doubt by applying the S1000 low pass filter that you could get it to sound pretty close to the S950. On the other hand, this is interesting, and I\u0026rsquo;ll have to see if there are any other experiments to follow in this space.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/11/27/s950-and-s1000-white-noise-and-drum-break-comparison/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA conversation started on MPC Forums about the \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=11\u0026amp;t=206423\"\u003eMPC \u0026amp; S900/950 Routing Question\u003c/a\u003e.

It is something I had not noticed in the first two recording sessions, but I\u0026rsquo;ll be keeping an eye out for it. I have a sneaking suspicion that it is related to the Spice, and the Korg NuTek tubes, because they have some weird knocking effects that if you tap on the case it can cause it to ring out noise. Strange, and it is not part of the audio chain, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible I\u0026rsquo;m picking up some grounding or other noises, so it will be worth looking into at some point, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t something I figured I\u0026rsquo;d go back and re-record everything.\nThis volume is less programs and samples than the previous ones, but it\u0026rsquo;s not for a lack of trying.

Additional glitchiness comes from Elements going into clouds, with some modulation on Clouds to keep some interesting movement in the sound.

This was not anything too fancy, and I tried to keep the impression light so that when I got to coloring the water wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pool too much. Of course, since I had already written on the other side of the page, this was bound to be a little suspect, but I wanted to try. Regardless, with the writing board behind the page, it worked well enough to get a rough outline down on paper. I suspect there is room to try some embossing techniques in the future, but for now I\u0026rsquo;ll just keep it in mind.\nCompared to yesterday where I ended up using a lot water with the pigment, I tried to control how much water was applied to the page. This resulted in quite a bit more control of the colors, I will say at first. Where I tried to apply a second coat, or use where it was subtly wet already to push the pigment, you can see the tones give that not quite consistent water color look. I also found with some careful rewetting of the pigment, that I could to some extent lift the color off of the page to a reasonable effect. I definitely find with lower quality papers that this can be a problem as the ink kind of penetrates the paper, and kind of doesn\u0026rsquo;t, which can lead to some different kinds of inconsistencies.\nFinally, I figured I would give the included brush pen that came with my Hobonichi purchase to do some sharp outlines. Yes, I know that no true water colorist would do this, but I was trying to see if I could do a striking design with mixed media on the page, and not a traditional water color painting. Given that I let the page dry before I did this black outline, I am quite happy that there was no bleeding, and the brush pen doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to have picked up much, if any of the pigment off of the page.\nYou probably cannot notice it from the picture, but after I did the brush pen outline, and letting it dry, I did go back with a brush to tighten up some of the non pigmented spots, which again, I feel worked well enough and through careful application didn\u0026rsquo;t really suffer from any additional pigment pooling issues. Finally, I went back at the picture somewhat carefully with an eraser to clean up some of the more egregious pencil marks, and for the most part the pigment and brush pen didn\u0026rsquo;t noticeably lift off the page, however my eraser tells a slightly different story, as it clearly did lift up a little bit of both. Not enough to damage the picture mind you, but enough to I know it is something to keep in mind to be careful of\u0026hellip; or possibly to use as an effect.\nOne last thought\u0026hellip; if you\u0026rsquo;re a texture adverse, I might suggest staying away from using water color on the Tomo River paper. It ends up feeling a bit gritty, so if you like that smooth finish of the paper, this is probably not a technique for you. Personally I don\u0026rsquo;t mind it, and think it gives the paper an additional level of character that you don\u0026rsquo;t entirely get from other types of paper.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/11/06/mixed-media-on-hobonichi-tomo-river-paper/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSince I have my travel water color kit sitting on my desk, and I ended up doodling a bit during some meetings, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d do a little mixed media and see how well the paper would handle it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start, I just did a pretty simple design sketch with a mechanical pencil (a Kuru Toga for those who want to keep track). This was not anything too fancy, and I tried to keep the impression light so that when I got to coloring the water wouldn\u0026rsquo;t pool too much. Of course, since I had already written on the other side of the page, this was bound to be a little suspect, but I wanted to try. Regardless, with the writing board behind the page, it worked well enough to get a rough outline down on paper.

It comes with a water brush, paint, and sponges, so I figured if I wanted to travel with it that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t take up too much space. If you look at the picture I painted, you can clearly see that the paper did distort a little bit, causing some pooling of water, which really is not optimal. I suspect that a regular brush, and a bit more towards a dry application, would create a much better effect. That said, I am quite impressed with how well the paper handled the water and dried, and while there is some pooling of the pigments it actually is not so bad.\nBest of all, the color didn\u0026rsquo;t bleed through the paper, and while it is quite noticeable on the other side of the page, if you\u0026rsquo;re a regular user of a writing board, you\u0026rsquo;ll hardly notice the pigmentation on the other side of the page.

For me, the problem is that the longer something sits in the inbox whether it is read or unread, the more likely you are to ultimately do nothing with it. Is this procrastination, optimism that somebody else will deal with the email, or lack of interest, frankly it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. In all cases it results in something that takes up mental space that you\u0026rsquo;d be better off freeing yourself from. These little things can add up to real setbacks.\nTo help combat this, I have taken the mindset that my inbox is a precious and limited resource, and I have come up with a loose process to keep myself honest with my emails, and in particular, my inbox.\nIf it is junk mail, I consistently look for the unsubscribe, and if it is repeat junk mail then I make a filter to auto delete it. Either way, I don\u0026rsquo;t need any more of this noise in my life. I check to see if it is informative, and if it is, I will read it, possibly move it to a relevant folder, or otherwise archive it. Many email systems allow you to archive emails these days, so that it is still searchable, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t taking up precious inbox space. Often an email comes in and I need to take an action on it. If I do, I make every attempt to deal with it right away. Sometimes the action is a response, which I will get to as quickly as possible, and then archive the message. Other times it is a delegation task and I just need to let somebody else know that they have an action. On the other hand, there are some emails that are things I would rather put off, or I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. For these, I tend to take a note, a ticket for work to be done, create a document, or otherwise let people know that I am at least tracking the work somewhere else and to not use the email as a place to track the work. If all of this sounds like a bit of work, and requires some mental fortitude I will agree. I often find I have 10-20 emails stuck in my inbox at any given time, but I also find that given enough time I usually just delete or archive half of them without doing any work in the first place.

This is kind of nice I guess to keep everything inside neat (even if it is ridiculously spacious in here)\u0026hellip; but this is where I made a horrible mistake.\nIf you look at the ribbon cable here, you can see that I accidentally snipped the cable\u0026hellip; and I have no idea when I did it. Probably when I cut the zip ties. To check my sanity to see if there were any issues, I ended up testing all of the buttons. I pretty quickly determined that the data button was not working, so I soldered the two ends together and confirmed that the data button started working again. I\u0026rsquo;m not proud of the accidental damage to the S1000, but at least it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too hard to fix.\nHere is the backlight working again. Guess what, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even replace it. After digging in there, moving stuff around, and just trying it again it was magically working. So now I have a snipped cable, a spare display, and I ordered a spare backlight. I probably don\u0026rsquo;t need all of this extra stuff for my display, but well\u0026hellip; there it is.\nIn the end it isn\u0026rsquo;t about repairing a broken backlight or not, it\u0026rsquo;s the adventures and mistakes we made to get there, and what we learned together in the end :D\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/10/07/akai-s1000-screen-repair/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week I turned on my S1000, to find that the screen backlight was no longer working.

I chuckled to myself, because this seems kind of strange to show up into sample names.\nWhy is this strange you may ask? Well, for starters the auto sampler uses both the note names, as well as the midi note numbers in the file name when you auto sample an instrument. This makes sense, even if it is duplicate information. However, when you do multiple velocity levels, the auto sampler adds f/fm/pm/p (or a subset there of) into the file names. Strange huh? Especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what it means.\nThe notation indicate loudness without specifying an actual or precise loudness. Essentially, it is up to the player to use their instincts, emotions, or placement within a surround environment and other instruments to determine how loud to play. To break it down for you, here\u0026rsquo;s a table to explain the various f/mf/mp/p meanings\nfffvery very loudffvery loudfloudmfnot so loudmpnot so quietpquietppvery quietpppvery very quietMusic Notation - Dynamics\nSo to break it down for the MPC, it\u0026rsquo;s basically recording samples denoted as loud, not so loud, not so quiet, and quiet, which covers your four velocity levels.\nThis is a complete assumption, but I am guessing that the reason Akai would do this is that it requires at most 2 characters to represent the four velocity layers for the auto sampled content, instead of needing 3 characters to represent from 000 to 127.\nPersonally, I am not a fan of this style of notation, and would have much preferred to see Akai use either hexadecimal notation which would still utilize only two characters, or to have done something the F/f/p/P to use only one character. Instead we have the solution that Akai went with, which is obtuse, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really help the person auto sampling understand what the values actually are without opening up the Program to see what the content is. Oddly, this leaves the artist with a clear indication of what the note is, what the midi note is, but the artist is left to speculate what the velocity may or may not mean.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for more information, check out the Wiki page Dynamics (music).\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to see some funny conversations on about this notation\u0026hellip; read below\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/10/06/music-notation-dynamics-akai-auto-sampler/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell over at the MPC Forums a user created a topic \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48\u0026amp;t=204251\"\u003eTidy Keygroup Names\u003c/a\u003e and thought that there was a bug when they were auto sampling, as it was putting f/p/fm/pm into the names of the samples instead of actual velocity.

This has resulted in many hours spent listening to story telling, comedy, news, educational, and a whole slew of other topics. With the pandemic, and the shift in how I use my time, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the time while driving to sit down and really listen, which has resulted in a massive backlog of nearly a hundred hours of unlisted to podcasts.\nSure, there have been plenty of favorites that have gone unlistened to, and a few mainstays that I have managed to catch up on while mowing the lawn, or dropping my daughter off at school, but by and large, it\u0026rsquo;s been a habit that has gone to the way side. I won\u0026rsquo;t dig into specific details for which Podcasts I have subscribed to, because honestly I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that would help anybody looking to trim down their list of Podcasts.\nThe last few weeks, I have been much more critical in thinking about these scant podcast listening minutes, and trying to consider what kind of information I actually want to be filling my brain with. This lead me to categorizing the Podcasts I have been listening to loosely as entertainment, informative, interest, advertisement. This has been what I have ended up with, and not all of these may apply to you. Let me break this down for you, and what I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to do with each of them, and note that some of the Podcasts I have subscribed to may overlap in several categories.\nEntertainment\nThings that have gone into the entertainment category for me, are Podcasts that I just listen to for fun. This may be for laughs, or to catch a good bit of story telling. What has struck me though has been just how many Podcasts I used to listen to for fun, got bored of, and have continued to download episodes for without listening to them. I\u0026rsquo;d say probably fifty percent of the Podcasts I have subscribed to fit the \u0026ldquo;lost interest\u0026rdquo;, and I have purged them from my subscription list. It was a pretty easy decision because if I\u0026rsquo;m being honest with myself, I was never going to go back to them anyways. It was time to put them away.\nInformative\nThese are Podcasts I have subscribed to in order to learn about something. There have been language building Podcasts, a few that I subscribed to while taking college classes, and quite a few that help learn about interest social, economic, or even just random topics. Personally, I place a high value on personal growth and education, and was a bit pickier when deciding which Podcasts to unsubscribe from. This mostly came down to me wanting to try and make sure I\u0026rsquo;m not just inundating myself with a single view point, but also I really do want to make time to continue language learning for example, but had lost some of those threads of interest in the wall of possibilities I had access to.\nInterest\nFor me at least, I just subscribed to a ton of content that I thought I would be interested in, but it turns out I have never made time to actual listen to. For my own sanity, any Podcasts that I had listened to two or less episodes and they didn\u0026rsquo;t stick for me, they frequently got the boot.\nAdvertisement\nThis might be subjective for folks, but there are plenty of Podcasts out there that in reality are just long advertisements to get you interested in products. This might be movies, video games, sports equipment, books, etc\u0026hellip; For me there is a fine line between being entertaining, and just spewing out opinions to get people to buy things. I removed just about everything in this category, advertising is targeted enough, and honestly, even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t a hard push, I don\u0026rsquo;t think that I need more excuses to spend money on things that I don\u0026rsquo;t need.\nOutcome\nIt might be funny, but I ended up unsubscribing from about fifty Podcasts, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be happier. This was all content that was taking up time to scroll through, used up storage, and ultimately wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing anything for me. Some things I might go back to\u0026hellip; in fact my daughter has already asked to listen to one particular Podcast that I unsubscribed to with me. Even though it might be a small weight off my shoulders, it still feels good to free up some more room for life.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/10/05/unsubscribing-from-podcasts/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know about others, but I have picked up quite a collection of Podcasts that I have subscribed to over the years.

There are companies putting out fun and cool new toys competing for our dollar, and it makes it super easy to end up spending a lot of money on gear that you don\u0026rsquo;t need, doesn\u0026rsquo;t inspire you, or just ends up consuming your time and taking you away from being productive.\nAn important factor is just knowing where you are in relation to your gear. Does it make you money, is it just a hobby, or is it somewhere in between? I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but unless you\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot of disposable income, it is unlikely that you can just save up for some new gear. Also, if you\u0026rsquo;re independently wealthy, I still think it is worth considering how much you\u0026rsquo;re really willing to invest because more gear does not directly equate to more music.\nFor me at least, there\u0026rsquo;s a balance to be struck between never picking up some new instruments or just setting out to get whatever your heart desires. Some of this can be offset by knowing what you have, what you want, and what you no longer need. There are plenty of secondhand markets to both buy and sell gear, so don\u0026rsquo;t let too much of your old gear get dusty, but also don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to hold onto something that you may still want to take use.\nWhat do you need?\nPersonally, I am an hobbies musician, I mostly do this for fun\u0026hellip; though I did used to make some money on the side producing music. I didn\u0026rsquo;t survive off of my music though, and didn\u0026rsquo;t ever transition into a starving artist. That said, feel free to take or leave my thoughts as they may or may not apply to your situation.\nOne reason to pick up some new gear is that something in your current kit that you have is broken, malfunctioning or no longer compatible with your setup. These are all very valid reasons to get something new, and is usually just a consideration of timeliness.\nIn particular though, I would like to highlight that when hardware and software that integrates with or is your DAW, if it goes out of date with your new computer, it does become a good time to consider if you want to stay on the \u0026ldquo;forever upgrade\u0026rdquo; train. I have countless plugins that I have abandoned in my environment because through the upgrade cycles and changes to new hardware platforms, sockets, and other interfaces they are no longer usable by me. What seemed like a great deal to invest in software years ago, has turned into rubbish that I can no longer use. Consideration is all I am asking.\nAnother important reason to pick up some new gear is to add something new to your music creation that you just cannot do today. Where to be harder on yourself is to consider does it really add something new, or is the \u0026rsquo;newness\u0026rsquo; just a factor to give yourself an excuse to pick up more gear you don\u0026rsquo;t really need, but it offers a characteristic that your existing gear doesn\u0026rsquo;t have. For example\u0026hellip; you might have a bunch of guitar pedals for various effects, but something new just came out that is basically the same as what you have, but it is portable. Now maybe you are imagining yourself hitting the road, and this would be really helpful, or are you just interested in getting it for whatever reason, but have convinced yourself in the moment that how portable it is makes the purchase worth it?\nProbably the last reason for me to consider is if the new gear makes me more effective or efficient. As a monetary consideration, especially for professionals this can be the key between loosing money and making money. As I said though, I am a hobbiest with my music, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to have a hard time convincing myself that something is saving me money. Your mileage may vary, but I am sure if you are doing this as a business you know how much it will cost you to pick up a specific piece of gear, figure out how much it will save you, and then determine how many jobs you\u0026rsquo;d have to take for it to break even and then start making you money.\nIs your music limited?\nI suspect that many musicians are pretty happy to make music with the gear that they have on hand, and can make plenty of compositions with what they have. Even with a guitar you can make percussive sounds knocking on the body. With even a basic sampler you can pitch shift and time stretch sounds into an infinite world of sounds. Sometimes these limits will make you more creative, and when you get the idea to purchase new gear perhaps instead you just need to take steps to reduce your setup and force yourself to work within an even more restricted environment. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn more about what you can do with your gear, and it might make you crack open a manual or check out a Youtube video for some fresh ideas.\nOn the other hand, once you really understand what your limits are, you may come to the conclusion that it is time to pick up something new and fresh to give you a new creative spark. I guess my suggestion though is to make sure that you know the difference between the gear you have and your own skill level. New gear will not give you new skills that you have not developed, and it is frustrating to get new gear the you will ultimately have the same problems with if you have not put the time in. The only way to combat this is to just put the time into your new gear.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/09/17/do-you-need-more-music-gear/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe all love adding new instruments, effects, processors, computers, mixers, samplers, recorders, display cases, and cables (well really, cables?), but we should all take the time to ask ourselves if we really need more gear!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs musicians, part of the fun in being creative is getting a new tool to express ourselves.

It has taken on the status of being an overpriced (released in 2011’ish at about $799 USD, today sells new for $1299 USD which was the latest price hike in 2019) piece of hipster music production hardware. It’s an interesting piece of gear, but isn’t exactly user friendly\u0026hellip; if you want to push yourself to think outside of the box, it has that in spades, but for me it is not a serious piece of music gear in today’s space.\nUnder the hood, it’s got about 12-15 (I forget) Synths, 2 Drums, I want to say about 10’ish FX, and about 10’ish different sequencers. The mentality for all of these is to (mostly) focus on four parameters (sometimes up to 8 through the shift key) to control. So it’s got a design aesthetic of keeping things mostly simple, and obfuscating what the controls are really doing. While you’ve got subtractive, fm, resonator, etc\u0026hellip; synthesis\u0026hellip; you don’t always have a direct correlation for one knob doing a straight LP/BP/HP filter or whatever it is\u0026hellip; this forces you to use your ears more to actually hear what is happening.\nIt’s also got a synth sampler which can record up to six seconds of audio that you can pitch up and down, and a drum sampler which can record up to twelve seconds of audio. I suspect a lot of the folks looking to produce “LoFi” tracks gravitate towards this limitation right here, because it absolutely forces you to do more with less as it were. You can definitely use the drum sampler for chopping up beats, but you’re kind of fighting with the auto chopping algorithm\u0026hellip;\nPersonally, I find the magic of it in the four track tape emulator, and how it handles looping. For me this is the biggest strength, because it definitely forces you to think about laying down audio in real time, versus sequencing content at your own leisure. Unfortunately this also becomes a huge weakness because if you want to make a full track on this thing, you’re stuck trying to work within the intricacies of the tape simulation to chop, lift, and drop tape segments. I tell people that this is fun until it is not. Sure you get happy accidents, but it’s still fairly easy to get clicks (you can hear a few in the track I posted).\nThis leads most people to a workflow of using the OP-1 to it’s advantage, and then moving to a DAW. Especially since\u0026hellip; and I laugh at this\u0026hellip; you can effectively only work on one project at a time. You can definitely use each of the four six minute tracks independently, or dump different songs at different time segments, but this is where (like four track tape decks) you can quickly feel like the device is actively working against you if you’re not working with it.\nAll that said though, it is great for getting ideas down, and it functions super well as a small device you can toss in your backpack. It has a built in microphone and radio\u0026hellip; so you can quickly sample sounds into it from those sources, it’s got a 1/8” input and output jack\u0026hellip; so with the right cables you can also hook just about any audio you want into it.\nWhere I am on the fence is actually mostly in the Midi implementation. It’s got a USB jack, and it can work as a class compliant midi device. There are templates to use it to control Ableton and Reason as well, so you can use the transport controls pretty well, and even map CC around. However, if you’re looking to clock lock to another device, you’re really going to need to either have a USB host device that will support it, or\u0026hellip; have a USB host device that can then perform your midi out/sync duties.\nWhat else? Well the keys are not velocity sensitive, so it becomes a bit awkward to program in high hat rolls for example with various velocity. There are a bunch of ways to do this, but what I usually end up doing is setting the record volume on the loud hats higher, and record that to tape\u0026hellip; then set the record volume lower on the quieter hats and record that to tape. If it sounds fiddly, it absolutely is\u0026hellip; and if you mess it up and have forgotten to save off an A/B copy of your tape can quickly lead to “well I have to do that again” moments. However this is mostly just an issue of layering. You *can* get one layer of undo by lifting a section of tape and then dropping it back down before you record\u0026hellip; but you have to remember to do this.\nAny way\u0026hellip; I personally like the device for what it is\u0026hellip; but the price tag for what it is\u0026hellip; well it is crazy. Sure it is a boutique synth\u0026hellip; but TE is a design company first.

It has taken on the status of being an overpriced (released in 2011’ish at about $799 USD, today sells new for $1299 USD which was the latest price hike in 2019) piece of hipster music production hardware. It’s an interesting piece of gear, but isn’t exactly user friendly\u0026hellip; if you want to push yourself to think outside of the box, it has that in spades, but for me it is not a serious piece of music gear in today’s space.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"MPC Forums OP-1 Question..."},{"content":" This is my third pass at a Synth Pop track. I did some cool stuff on the MPC Live, but it is definitively not Synth Pop. Something I will absolutely put together as a finished track, but both tracks strayed from the Synth Pop sound way too much, and I decided I\u0026rsquo;d give it one more try.\nThis entire track was done \u0026ldquo;in the box\u0026rdquo; on the OP-1\u0026hellip; the Drum Synth did the \u0026ldquo;heavy lifting\u0026rdquo; for the drum samples\u0026hellip; and I ran it through various FX to get the sound I hit. The FM Synth did almost all of the Bass and Lead sounds\u0026hellip; I know this isn\u0026rsquo;t DX7 territory, but whatever. Really the only non FM synth sound here comes courtesy of the DR Wave Synth that has that noisy and tinny piano sounds only the back end of the track.\nFor those of you who have experience with the OP-1\u0026hellip; I just tracked sounds out, usually with a single pass, so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really doing too much as far as multiple layers\u0026hellip; I intentionally did this so that I could focus on 4 specific tracks that worked as mono, instead of getting stereo depth\u0026hellip; so yeah, no stereo sounds unfortunately, but I just wanted to avoid getting to crazy with layers so that I could play the track mutes a bit more live.\nFor the drums, I wanted the super programmed sound, instead of going without timing correct\u0026hellip; so for the drums I used the Finger sequencer and just programmed out tracks and used the record/sequencer player to just record in straight\u0026hellip; for the arpeggios I used Arpeggio to really just play out two variations of F/G# and C/D#. Yeah, actually nothing exciting, but I put Arpeggio into a mode where it was transposing out 4 notes, for either variation randomly\u0026hellip; I could\u0026rsquo;ve figured out the scale, but plenty of Synth Pop bands didn\u0026rsquo;t really care either\u0026hellip; so to heck with it\n:D\nLaying down each section of the track was effectively me just putting the OP-1 into looper mode, and holding down the sequence for \u0026ldquo;about 4 bars\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; which lead to a few glitchier parts since sometimes this would lead to the loop start doubling up a sound\u0026hellip; again\u0026hellip; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going for perfection here. Either I was being lazy, or you can figure the glitches are part of the sound/process of synth pop.\nAt the end of last week, I had roughly a minute of audio\u0026hellip; and I was really not looking forward to doing a whole mess of copy/pasting\u0026hellip; this is probably the worst part of the OP-1 experience for those of you that haven\u0026rsquo;t done it. I honestly tried, but although I felt the sound from start to finish was pretty good, I really couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a good place to drop from the end, to work my way back and making a full track. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that makes sense or not\u0026hellip; but it does to me. I also seriously considered bringing the loops into either Ableton or Reason, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t inspiring me\u0026hellip; and I was part way in feeling like I had something kind of cool, but just not worth the hassle.\nThis leaves me at the start of the week, not wanting to be a no show since I\u0026rsquo;ve put so much work into the various tracks, I had to kick myself in the ass to just try something. I was enjoying the track from start to end, but new I was going to have a hard time making a track in a DAW\u0026hellip; so I decided to take a stab at playing it out live. I am definitely not an OP-1 ninja, as you can see from the video\u0026hellip; but I figured I could make a passable try at it. Plus what is Synth Pop other than working with what you have to fake it until you make it\n:D\n.\nAt any rate, this is my favorite take out of a dozen or so attempts to put something down. If I was trying to actually do something serious I\u0026rsquo;d definitely cut the best parts and mix them in Ableton, but whatever\u0026hellip; my punk side is saying take it or leave it, and this was quite fun to do. My only regret is having some lyrics for this track, but not getting the vocals together. I\u0026rsquo;d blame this on the limited number of tracks on the OP-1, but honestly I found the tempo a bit too awkward to work with, and slowing the track speed down to record vocals introduced some very undesirable side effects to the sound, most notably the pitch.\nNot sure if there is any interest\u0026hellip; but I will offer to use the auto sampler on the Live to record off key groups if anybody cares for the FM sounds or Piano sounds I used to create the song before I nuke the settings on the OP-1.\nSo yeah\u0026hellip; now you guys can imagine me as a hipster drinking green smoothies out of a mason jar while I pretend to make music on an OP-1\n:D\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/09/03/mpc-forums-synth-pop-challenge-systematic-noise/","summary":"\u003cdiv style=\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\"\u003e\n      \u003ciframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen\" loading=\"eager\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJJWWOHumuc?autoplay=0\u0026amp;controls=1\u0026amp;end=0\u0026amp;loop=0\u0026amp;mute=0\u0026amp;start=0\" style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\" title=\"YouTube video\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is my third pass at a Synth Pop track.

We would frequently extend internships, and occasionally bring interns on as full time employees. Often this was done to help retain talent, but I would always talk to these employees to make sure that they would continue their school.\nHowever, a handful of employees over the years just never went back and completed their schooling. Is this necessarily bad? My concern is the potential wage gap difference. Sure you can learn a lot on the job, but employers are frequently interested to see what prospects have accomplished. To somebody looking through resumes and seeing somebody that hasn\u0026rsquo;t completed their schooling, it just leaves a lot of open questions.\nIn one particular case, I had an employee that was just tired of Computer Science, and ended up shifting to a Project Management profession. This certainly makes the argument easier against completing the program, but I just feel that there is so much value in finishing off on parts of your education. It gives a measurable sense of accomplishment, helps foster perseverance and tenacity, and shows that you are can be committed to yourself and your own development.\nFor those college students getting offers, I congratulate you!

Just my opinions\u0026hellip; take it or leave it :)\nApple apologizes to Wordpress, no longer requires free app to add purchases\nWhen I read last week that Apple was removing the Wordpress app from the Apple store I thought things were getting a little strange. The application never had payments in place, and you had to go to the Wordpress site to pay for your subscription. I suspect that given everything going on with Epic and the Fortnight fiasco that Apple is just getting overly sensitive about companies removing their ability to get a 30% cut.\nAt a high level I get it, creating an online store, payment processing, and all that is expensive. These big companies need to protect their base or risk somebody coming in and taking their lunch, but on the other hand Apple is one (of many) companies that seem to be taking more than their fair share of the value.\nI digress though, Apple has backed down from their removal of Wordpress, and has reinstated the application. Interesting times for Apple iOS developers to keep a pulse on for sure.\n480%+, why is Nintendo worried?\nDuring my MBA study I did a lot of research on Nintendo, and I’ve tried to keep up with where Sean Malstrom is thinking the Nintendo direction is going. It does look like troubling times for Nintendo as they are stuck between console generations for Sony and Microsoft, and it is unclear what exactly they will be putting out for hardware or software over the next year.\nThe promise from Nintendo had been by merging the console and handheld line into a single system that we’d get more development on the Switch platform. I think the expectation from consumers was that this would mean more high quality software coming out from Nintendo, but instead we’ve continued to get releases at about the pace of a single system.\nClearly hardware continues to be difficult to develop, but it’s hard to see what the consumer benefits are. Nintendo is allowing many many ports onto the system, but a lot of this is shovel ware, and not really worth the asking price. You can see this because there are just so many sales going on all the time.\nNintendo used to be the platform that stood for quality, but they seem to have switched to a platform of quantity. I know market dynamics have changed over the years, especially as downloadable software has greatly reduced the cost of software delivery to consumers, but I’m just not sure where all this is headed.\nI had not been aware of the business term Melt Up before, but I think I can guess at what it means. At any rate, gave it a quick read of the definition of Melt Up. I was pretty close. What is scary is all the advice saying “Invest cash now”, but the immediate problem is if you invest now, when should you cash out? The stock market is already legal gambling\u0026hellip; but telling people when to buy in but no wise words on when to cash out so they can make a call for themselves is scary. I suspect I’ll be trying to look more into Melt Up over the next few days.\n7 Mistakes Many of Us Are Making With Our Money During the Pandemic\nThis article hits a few concerns I have in general, but in particular for things that try and give financial advice. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to provide opinions as my responses, but please, go find an actual financial advisor for actual financial advice!\nNot Pocketing $225 for watching the news - I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, but I am already concerned about how much of my personal data that big companies have about me. Do I really want to invite more of this into my home? This is also an \u0026ldquo;up to\u0026rdquo;, so how much money can somebody realistically make? It feels super intrusive to me, but I\u0026rsquo;d love to hear somebody\u0026rsquo;s experience using this. For me though\u0026hellip; not going to get into my home. Passing up $500 in Free Stocks - Again, another piece of advice with an \u0026ldquo;up to\u0026rdquo; tag associated with it. Do you really want to sign up for a stock platform, especially Robinhood. I am sure people have made money on this platform, but I have read countless articles of users burying themselves in debt because they don\u0026rsquo;t really understand their leverage or risk. I\u0026rsquo;d be super leery of this app myself, I might check it out, but I already have access to well established stock brokers. Not Setting Aside $1M For Your Family - How many of us are really insurable for a million dollars? Especially for $8 a month\u0026hellip; the people being referenced getting it at this rate must be younger. Any place reputable I have gotten insurance from will do a phone screened interview, but for this kind of money they are absolutely going to want to see you in person to do a health assessment. Wasting Hundreds on Homeowners Insurance - It is probably worth shopping around to see if you can get a lower monthly fee for home insurance. There are deals out there, and it is possible Lemonade offers better rates. I\u0026rsquo;d check things out though, as I\u0026rsquo;ve only ever gone with local insurance companies myself. Not Buying a Piece of Amazon, Google or Another Company - I would like to point out that owning stock in a company is different than owning the company. Also, these billionaires made their money building their company from the ground up, buying stocks in an established company is not the same as investing at the ground floor. Sure you can make money in the stock market, but I\u0026rsquo;d caution that you really need to understand a lot of how the market works before considering investing in it. Wasting Money on Car Insurance - This is another one where I\u0026rsquo;d say it pays to keep your eyes open and look once in a while. You can get savings by bundling this with your home owners insurance as well. It\u0026rsquo;s always worth calling your current insurance agency, let them know how your habits have changed, and see what they can do to work with you. Paying Your Whole Credit Card Bill - Well I have to absolutely agree with this. I know it is tough times right now, but absolutely spend within your means, credit is absolutely dangerous and can turn into a crazy downhill slide. I\u0026rsquo;d be super careful of any of these agencies that say they will consolidate your debt for a fee though. I know too many people who have taken this step, only to find out they are paying another company to do nothing but take their money, and then they have more interest and late fees piling up. Be very, very cautious of what you do with your money!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/24/2020-08-24-the-big-melt/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eArticles and videos that hit my feed and some thoughts on them.

I decided to jump into the next challenge for Electro Funk, and was listening to a lot of tracks from the era. If you want to check out the main post on MPC Forums for the Electro Funk Challenge, well go on over here. Been a lot of discussion again, and I think it was the third page I dropped a number of YouTube videos, most of which are in the right style.\nSo where to start? Well\u0026hellip; I created a track, and then promptly lost it. I was sending an SD card to my brother in law to check some things out, and I forgot to make a backup of the project files\u0026hellip; and whoops, I had left the project file on the SD card that I sent him. This set me back quite a bit. I hemmed and hawed quite a bit, but ended up deciding to just restart the track from everything that I had learned.\nThe first track had the following values:\nKeep it to mono synth only Emulate drum machine sounds Go vocoder crazy Very limited effects The track was pretty good! I ended up recording several takes through some guitar pedals to see if I could add any sound to it. Unfortunately\u0026hellip; I also forgot to save the project\u0026hellip; *ugh*. So guess what\u0026hellip; the only version of the song that I have is the processed tracks, that are a bit muddy. I have uploaded one of the takes, just for comparison.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/robot-love-logic-test\nFrom loosing the project file, I seriously considered just bailing on the challenge, but figured I should take another stab at it. Through getting things kicked off I had learned a bit about the style, and figured I could give it a passable, if potentially only fair shake.\nTo work on starting over on the track I figured I\u0026rsquo;d throw everything away and go fresh. I immediately decided I\u0026rsquo;d rather go for a more rock drum sound instead of focussing on drum machine style sounds. I felt a bit more connected to the sounds in the genre that used real drums, that was my reasoning, so I went with it.\nNext up, I worked on getting an 808 bass line going. This was something that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t done in the first iteration of the track, as instead I had tried to build out my own bass sound that I thought could compete. Maybe it could have, but the track I posted above you can hear, it is a bit muddy. This new track the 808 cut through a lot better. One thing that helped with the sound was turning off timing correct for almost all of the sounds. It was a bit of a struggle at first to get the drums, keys, and everything to gel, but it gives so much of a better sound. The swing may feel subtle in some ways, but at least for me, it totally works.\nFrom here, I just messed with a few sequences to get some sounds going so I could flip through my Moog Voyager and find some great mono synth sounds. For both tracks, the focus was on keeping the synths monophonic, but in this new track I figured I\u0026rsquo;d stretch into using analog guitar pedals for effects. This added a lot more variety to the sounds on offer, without really having to do too much. Since I was focussed more the second pass through on being efficient, I really just used the Looper on my AKAI MPC Live mk2, and this gave me plenty of two, four, and eight bar loops that were very workable. On the other hand, I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend any time on building out key groups or drum kits, so\u0026hellip; *shrug* save yourself time now, pay for it later in the future if you want the sound again?\nOriginally the new track was going to be called Funky Alligator, and was to be instructions for how to make the drink \u0026ldquo;Funky Alligator\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; I figured it was cornball enough for lyrics that it could be fun and catchy, but driving the audio through a vocoder kept crushing it into just unintelligible enough that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it. I probably needed another hour or two so I could get enough takes to have it be \u0026ldquo;okay\u0026rdquo;. Fortunately my brother in law came through with sending me back just enough of the original project that I could at least recover the lyrics. They were practically a drop in replacement, and honestly, still sounded fine by my ears\u0026hellip; and just needed some mixing to get it to sit well with the rest of the track.\nConclussions\u0026hellip;\nWell I\u0026rsquo;m not totally sure I nailed the electro sound. I feel like I hit the synth sound, but possibly went a bit too far with the number of sounds and some of the guitar effects are a little too much more than I heard on most of the tracks. The vocoder sound is also not really an authentic vocoder, and is instead a PO-35. Does this matter? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure, it\u0026rsquo;s in the right ballpark, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it is a home run.\nFor the next challenge, assuming I jump head first into it, I might take this a step further and intentionally work on two different tracks so I can pull out the best of both worlds again. Honestly, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like as much a waste of time at the end as I would have thought, and really helped me get out of my own head space and consider quite a few factors differently.\nAll told, this was all put together with an AKAI MPC Live mk2, a Moog Voyager as the king, a PO-35 for vocals, and a mess of Chase Bliss guitar pedals to add effects. I did very light mixing duty in Ableton Live, just enough to track things in and out a bit better, but there aren\u0026rsquo;t any effects, chopping tricks, or anything else to speak of. This fact is definitely getting me to think that the Akai Force might actually be something I could jump more into for working on tracks if I wanted to go that route for audio work. We shall see.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/14/electro-funk-robot-love/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/robot-love\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/robot-love\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis track has been a bit of a labor of love\u0026hellip; haha.

I keep going back to Apple Podcasts every major release or new hardware deployment, but it just never sticks for me. The feature set is absolutely fine as it is, and if there were no other options I would probably stick with it.\nApple Podcasts\nI upgraded to a new Mac, and have decided to give the Apple Podcasts app another spin. One thing that jumps out immediately is that it is not sync\u0026rsquo;ing podcasts across my iOS device and my Mac. Perhaps this is a feature that should work, but I would expect like most other Apple apps that this would be pretty simple to setup. There is an option under preferences to sync between devices, but it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to do anything. I suppose I could search for how to do this on the internet, if it is there, it might as well not exist if it is not easy to figure out.\nStill, I downloaded a few Podcasts that I listen to into the app, and the interface certainly is pretty easy to search for Podcasts and it is not too complicated to play things. This is something that I could see telling people to use. It does come with any of your Apple devices after all.\nOn the other hand, I guess I have been spoiled\u0026hellip;\nOvercast\nI have been using Overcast for a few years now, and as a free app, it is what I would expect to be essential to download for anybody who likes to listen to podcasts. Yes it does have ads, but they are quite out of the way and not obtrusive for operation of that application. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like the advertisements, you can get a yearly subscription. The yearly subscription also lets you upload files directly into Overcast, which sounds like a pretty handy feature. I have not subscribed and have not used it, but I can certainly envision using this feature one of these days.\nSync\u0026rsquo;ing podcasts between iOS and iPad devices has been super easy. As a result of writing this blog post I checked again to see if there is a Mac app for this, and unfortunately there is not. Maybe when we can run iOS or iPad apps on our Mac this will become an moot point, but if you do need to sync between many devices this might be a sticking point.\nFor me, the best feature of Overcast is the \u0026ldquo;Smart Speed\u0026rdquo; setting, which plays audio faster not by speeding it up, but by reducing silence and pauses that are natural part of language. Just with this setting turned on, I am often listening to podcasts at 1.2 to 1.5 times faster. You also have the ability to increase the play speed as well, which can get you an incredible speed increase for playing audio. Personally I am not a fan of listening to the podcast faster than what \u0026ldquo;Smart Speed\u0026rdquo; offers because I find it harder to concentrate on, but users have the option to manage several settings to increase or decrease podcast speed at your leisure.\nOvercast also includes an option \u0026ldquo;Voice Boost\u0026rdquo; which effectively adds some compression to increase the overall volume of the podcast. I find this incredibly helpful in keeping a consistent volume level making it much easier to listen to a podcast and maintain a reasonable volume control.\nConclussion\nIt is probably no surprise, but I\u0026rsquo;ll be sticking with Overcast for the time being. I suspect that there is little to anything that Apple is going to do for now to improve their podcast app, but I will still keep an eye out for it or any other applications that might be worth trying out.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/08/11/listening-to-podcasts-apple-podcasts-vs-overcast/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to podcasts for a number of years now in the iOS environment.

I mean I literally had everything and the kitchen sink in there, but it just wasn’t gluing together. So, I just decided to take a hatchet to a lot of the tracks, removing things that I liked, but really didn’t contribute, and figuring out which parts just needed more space to breath more life into the track.\nThe saddest part for me to remove was the guitar, first because I was taking it out because I was going to collaborate with DawgFather, and then later when I knew he wasn’t able to contribute I just kept making some of the other sounds richer and left very little room for a guitar to cut through without destabilizing the rest of the mix.\nI’m usually the first person to throw everything in too, but I wanted to take this more seriously and put my old school production hat on. I easily spent eight to ten hours on this track, and I have not spent that much time on a track in at least ten, maybe fifteen years. I used to do a lot of collaborations back in the day, but never actually made a career out of it.\nAnother “trick” I pulled was to actually have two different drum tracks running at the same time. This helped give the impression of ghost notes, shore up some weaker drum hits, and give some more overall variation to the sound. Normally when I program out my drum patterns I try and get something “locked in”, and then think about another layer that can be a bit looser. Sometimes it works and let’s the listener feel their way through the track with some happy surprises, and sometimes it sounds like you have a drunk friend that you need to tell to stop playing in the background. Hopefully I nailed it, and didn’t sound too drunk :D\nThe biggest part to nail for me though was the bass. I really struggled here, because the bass just takes up so much headroom to begin with, and I *really* wanted it to slam throughout this track. Seriously, the big bass sound, with some of the high end distortion in there is the biggest reason I needed to peel away so much from the original song. I don’t care what you guys might say… I dig it, even if it is a *bit* too in your face.\nOtherwise, really pulling the track together required many many many repeat listens. I effectively had it locked in two weeks ago, but the extra time let me polish off some of the serious blemishes, like peaking too high in some section, fixing some of the areas that came in super loud due to mega chords, and all that. A good portion of it was throwing in subtle compression just to get the organ and other chords to play nice, sometimes reducing note velocity, all that fun stuff. It turned into a labor of love because editing velocity note by note requires a lot of replays to listen to across a verse to get it right, or dropping a compressor can make one part great and mess up the rest of the track. This is just bog standard mixing duties, I don’t find it terribly interesting, but it is worth the time investment in really wrapping a track up. Seriously, listening to the track on every freaking speaker I could find gave me as much information as I needed to mix it all by ear. And hey, you guys can make fun of it, but the Live mk2’s speaker allowed me to get at least 80% of the way through the mix. Course if you want to hate, I can use it as an excuse of why it sounds so bad!\nOverall, this was a super fun exercise that had it all. A trip down memory lane, something to share with family and friends to get feedback, plenty of drama in the thread, and some great folks to chat about production with.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/31/jammin-interpolation-funked-up/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb-jammin-interpolation-challenge-funked-up-final-mix\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb-jammin-interpolation-challenge-funked-up-final-mix\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll kick off first and foremost, this entire track was done on the MPC Live mk2.  Not for any particular reason, but I started there, and just kept going.  Being able to unplug the device while taking my daughter out to ballet, horseback riding, waiting for my wife to finish shopping… whatever it was, was certainly helpful.  Besides auto sampling a few synths, everything was done in the box including fx, mixing, mastering, all that.  I know a lot of folks know it is possible, but for those who doubt it, maybe this changes your mind?  I actually expected a few times to want to be reaching for Ableton, Reason, or Melodyne to do a few things, but that was frequently when I was away from my computer and I just pushed my way through it.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Jammin Interpolation - Funked Up"},{"content":"My first MPC was the Akai MPC 1k Black. I really cut my teeth on this MPC over the years, and with JJOS it really made the MPC 1k shine. Life was pretty simple, but it had been given an amazing workflow for chopping, sampling, and writing music. I bought it back when the black model was released, and held on to it until just this year. Watching the prices of a lot of the old gear I had sky rocket, it was hard to justify keeping it around, especially since it was living mostly in it\u0026rsquo;s old box. As I\u0026rsquo;ve written about before, I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep old gear around for the sake of keeping it, and it was just time to part with the MPC 1k along with a lot of the other gear that has gone out the door, hopefully on to better homes that will appreciate and use the gear to the fullest.\nThrough all this time having the MPC 1k, I\u0026rsquo;ve also gone through three Akai MPC 500s. Honestly, the MPC 500 is a great little machine and has resulted in my being able to drop a number of tracks while traveling and doing things on the go. Sure I lugged the 1k around with me on a lot of trips over the years, but the 500 is just so much more road friendly. I still have an MPC 500, the one I\u0026rsquo;ve blogged about picking up recently, that was in dire need of repair. In all seriousness though, I am thinking about selling this repaired 500 as well, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I need even two MPCs, and while it\u0026rsquo;s nice to have something easy to toss in a backpack, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I really need it right now.\nSo\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ve been through the 1k, the 500\u0026hellip; and roughly when it first came out I picked up the MPC Live. I really dug the machine, but I was always jealously eyeing the MPC X. For one, I\u0026rsquo;d never had a full sized MPC, and second it had CV outs. I\u0026rsquo;ve been getting into Eurorack for a while now, and the idea of being able to sequence through CV and gates was really appealing to me. Which lead me to picking up the Akai MPC X a couple of years ago. Yes, at one point I had four MPCs, but I never saw myself as a collector. Eventually I decided to part with the Akai MPC Live, because seriously who needs four MPCs. The interoperability between the Live and the X was nice, but it was a bit much.\nThen this year along came the MPC One, which I was seriously considering picking up as a straight up replacement to the MPC 1k, it\u0026rsquo;s about the same size, but with a boatload of functionality. I was imagining it being my portable device, but I soured on that idea pretty quickly when I started considering needing an external power source. However, the CV was interesting to me for sure. Not much longer afterwards the Akai MPC Live mk2 was announced, and I just made the rash decision to get it. This put me back up to four MPCs again. Notice I already mentioned I am not a collector, yet here I was. With four.\nFor anybody who\u0026rsquo;s been sticking through all the gear I\u0026rsquo;ve been selling, and reading up on my Eurorack, you might have picked up on the fact that I am really working to reduce the amount of space my music gear takes up. Well a big unknown factor was how much space I would have, or even need, once the Eurorack case I bought back in January would take. Once I got it onto the table though, I could *clearly* tell that I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough room for all of the MPCs and other gear that I\u0026rsquo;d like to have room for. Plus, the MPC Live mk2 had the CV outs that I initially wanted, so it definitely made the choice to post the MPC X for sale much easier. Below I\u0026rsquo;ll post a picture of everything that I\u0026rsquo;ve currently got for gear setup.\nWhat you can see here is\nA whole mess of eurorack in the Erik Needham Woodworks case Akai MPC Live mk2 12 Chase Bliss guitar pedals in a pedal board Access Virus TI2 Darkstar Moog Voyager 50th Anniversary Edition Akai MPC 500 Moog CV Expander and CP-251 Patch Bay Apex Aural Exciter Akai Z8 Akai S1000 Akai S950 Not shown I also have a drawer with a few more gadgets\nTeenage Engineering PO-32, PO-33, and PO-35 Teenage Engineering OP-1 Teenage Engineering OP-Z Critter \u0026amp; Guitari Organelle M Zoom H6 Bastl Instruments Micro Granny Korg Triton Studio My gear collection has more or less been greatly paired down to size, but I still am trying to figure out how to get everything else into this reduced space. Now maybe I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be digging quite so deep, but here are my thoughts at this time. Heck, I\u0026rsquo;m even considering selling off everything below the table. While I do enjoy using the S950 and S1000, they don\u0026rsquo;t nearly get the love and attention that I used to give them back in the day.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also considering picking up the Waldorf Iridium. I had it on pre-order, but cancelled once I saw that there was just no way to fit it into this setup without selling something off. Since I haven\u0026rsquo;t pulled the trigger on selling off anything I figured the only fair thing to do was to cancel the pre-order, instead of putting myself in the position to agonize over what to sell off next.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve clearly still got some more decisions to make, but I want to make one thing clear\u0026hellip; reducing what I have for gear has greatly enabled me to get my music and music making far more focussed. Honestly, I think the next big step for me is deciding how much each device is bringing something unique to the table as a decision point for keeping it or selling it off. I\u0026rsquo;ve got some hard decisions to make fore sure!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/30/my-akai-mpc-journey-or-why-i-sold-my-mpc-x/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy first MPC was the Akai MPC 1k Black.

The sample I went for is Miles Davis - So What.\nThe rules I went for were any external sounds allowed, but you have to sample whatever you want to add from a microphone. No mic simulations allowed.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot to flip in that sample, but I tried to keep myself under control and see what I could do with a few sections to loop and do some change ups instead of straight up chops.\nInitial microphone recording tests stunk. Of course, using a lower quality microphone absolutely did not help the situation. Shame on me, I ended up with a bunch of junk content that just clashed with the track.\nDrum break was sample in through the mic, and took several attempts to get it at the right level. I wanted the mic to pick up *some* of the room ambience, but not loose out on too much of the low end. For me, the sweet spot on the D880 was about an inch from the mic, and just pushing the gains super high. I got a tiny bit of clipping, but nothing bad.\nThe Kick just took a lot of patience, and I ended up playing the kick drum sound out of my phone into the D880, and just kept playing it until I got a good hit with a tiny bit of distortion and some solid volume. I think it\u0026rsquo;s not quite right for the track, but it is what it is.\nThe snare\u0026hellip; hahaha\u0026hellip; this was the only element I kept from my sampling expedition with the Bastl Instruments Microgranny. The speaker is tiny, and the sampling engine I believe is 8-bit, but it could be 12-bit. I forget off hand. Anyways, this was part of me running around the house hitting things, recording it, and then pitching the sounds around. This was pretty much the only \u0026ldquo;usable\u0026rdquo; sound\u0026hellip; at least for this BB.\nVocals\u0026hellip; well I ran the D880 into a Plankton Electronics Spice, and used the Korg Nutone tube to drive the vocals. To get what I did took about 30 takes, and was me just about whispering into the mic, and getting this overdriven signal. I had some awesome takes that were super overdriven and sounded cool, but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work with the track as it was coming together\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll have to save them for another day.\nOverall, I played with five or six microphones of varying quality. I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to say the D880 was my hero this time, because it has very directional sound and needs quite close proximity. Some of the other mics I have can pic up sounds 100 feet away and it nearly sounds like it is right beside you\u0026hellip; which is both annoying and kind of creepy when you\u0026rsquo;re just trying to get a clean enough sample to work with and you can hear the kids shows popping up in the sample.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/28/mpcbb-286-runnin-outta-time/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb-286-runnin-outta-time\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb-286-runnin-outta-time\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo I won last week\u0026rsquo;s Beat Battle and got to pick the rules and the sample.

The only addition that is not from Claude is the drums, which come courtesy of a Guns N\u0026rsquo; Roses break. I then ran the PO-33 patterns through a armada of Chase Bliss Audio guitar pedals, to in particular really wear the sound out further… compliments definitely go to Condor for doing some EQ duties, Warped Vinyl for wearing done and warbling some of the hits, and Generation Loss for really cutting into some of the tape noise/wow/flutter. Mood provided some great inspirations that I was really hoping to add to the track, but it was just too much, and the track was becoming too complicated in spite of the cool and fun sounds.\nThere wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything too exciting, but I did make a lot of different sounds with this that I recorded into my Zoom H6, and then loaded it up into Ableton Live to just chop and process a tiny bit. Live mostly just did tracking here more than anything other heavy lifting. I had a lot of interesting ideas, but unfortunately they just didn\u0026rsquo;t work out well in the track, so I just nixed that junk off.

This was entirely an exercise to force myself to get it completed, since I am kind of running out of time, and I wanted to see where I could go if I just unrealistically restricted myself. My primary goal was to make sure that I wanted to limit the number of takes I did to put this together, and figure out how to glue it together in a way that it would sound coherent.\nMy first stop was to find a four bar section that looped well enough that I could chop it up into something useful. Once I isolated the loop, I moved to chopping, I was hoping that using regions I could get it pretty close, but there was a few hits that were pretty off beat, and a bit of swing thrown in for good measure. So post creating regions, I needed to go through and adjust end points. Honestly, this isn\u0026rsquo;t so bad on the MPC Live mk2, and I was able to get it where I wanted it. Once I set the tempo, I spent some time listening to the chops at different semitones, and decided to go with a straight up -6 semitone drop, and I liked the character I was getting out of it.\nFrom there it was a matter of finding some drums, bass, and fx that sounded decent enough with the track, and that I could live with putting down given my time constraints. From here I knocked out a few four bar drum and bass (not drum n\u0026rsquo; bass) tracks, and then made them into a 32 bar long sequence. From here I just got to work dropping in the sample chops until I was happy with the sounds\u0026hellip; which I was, but I figured some use of delay, feedback, and reverb would help glue the sound together and make it sound a bit more chilled out.\nThe finishing touches really were just trying to drop in a few one shot hits, deciding on a couple of key insert effects, and then just exporting the content out to a file to upload to soundcloud. See, nothing to it? Is this my favorite track, no, but seriously, it\u0026rsquo;s given me some thought to spending so much time grumbling over minutia so often.

About a week and a half ago I hit a 59 day streak for closing all of the rings on the Apple Watch, and then it stopped. In the last two weeks I have not been closing all of my rings despite my exercise right being frequently over flowing. What is going on?\nI spent some time thinking about this and if I should be upset with myself or not. I had been really looking to get healthier over the last few months, and boy do I feel like I have in some ways disappointed myself by not closing all of the rings. As with many things in life though, I had to spend some time considering why this may not be the case.\nOn average, I am not exercising about 50 minutes a day, which is *much* higher than I have been doing in the past by a large margin. Before the pandemic I was likely to get 10-15 minutes of exercise, and now I am at least tripling that. This feels really great, and I do feel like I have far more energy lately, no complaints here. This lead me to thinking about what is up and what is going on?\nI have been looking into the Apple Watch data for my exercises, and I have come to the conclusion that my heart rate is much lower for doing the exact same exercises I have been doing over the last two months. This is absolutely a good thing, and indicates to me that my heart and lung health is getting much better. The interesting thing is that the way that the move ring is representing this is that I am burning fewer calories, hence why my move ring is not closing lately, for the same amount of effort.\nSome of this has been due to taking my dogs out for a walk, and they just naturally slow things down because of needing to stop for them to go to the bathroom, let them smell something interesting, or having to stop while we let a vehicle drive by.\nAll of these things are telling me good things about the exercise I have taken, but it is also showing me that it is time for me to start varying my exercise activity so that I push myself more. I think I am going to start by adding a jog into my routine instead of just walking, and see how that changes things.\nThe great thing about having all of this data is that you can dig into it as much as you want, and interpret as it makes sense for you. Am I thinking about the data the right way or wrong way for myself? I think I am mostly getting it right, though as I work through this and run myself through some experiments only time will tell how it changes for me.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/13/not-closing-move-rings/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo here is a bit of a quandary for me.

All the sampling and mixing was done within the little box. I continue to like this little device because it really forces you to think about a potentially crippling amount of sampling time and a very real four note polyphony limit. Some of the previous tracks I have done really ran into the polyphony wall, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exactly drop notes the way I would expect at least.\nAll that said, I really just wanted to create a more fresh and summery track this time around. The piano if I recall was an A minor chord, and I recorded in the bass note as an A#. From there I just searched around for a few beats, and ended up settling for a beat that needed some work in the PO-33 to square it away because it was kind of noisy and while it had movement needed some other help. I followed that with recording some scratching in so that I could chop that up and make some scratch variations throughout the song.\nI ended up pretty quickly settling on a four bar loop that was the initial drums, scratching, bass, and piano. With some vocals this would absolutely have been enough to carry the song for as long as somebody wanted to record, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite happy with the vocals I was coming up with. If there is a track I will come back to some day with vocals though, this is likely the one!\nAnyways\u0026hellip; this was about a week ago, and I had intended to finish the track while I was out on a trip with my family and my parents up north. I brought the PO-33 and my OP-1 with me and was intending to record the pattern into the OP-1 and then go through and try some vocals, and then settling in for some mixing in master. Through some unfortunate events though the OP-1 got lost\u0026hellip; it has since been found, but it is not in my possession at this time. Doh.\nWhat with having the week off, and finishing off some beat battle tracks, I really figured I should just dust off the PO-33 and get this track down. I did some mastering work in the Akai MPC mk2, and then exported it out to Ableton Live for some minor arrangement changes. Overall I am happy with the track, but I feel like this is absolutely asking for some kind of remix. I ended up spending some time with the PO-32 to fill out some of the drum sounds, and this one patch based off of the PO-32 ended up consuming the bulk of my PO-33 sample time. Doh\u0026hellip;\nI did try to do some lyrics on the PO-35, and while it didn\u0026rsquo;t sound bad, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t really the tone I was going for. I probably should have saved it off first though, because somehow the speed knob got hit, and none of the samples I recorded line up with the PO-33 track. Ugh\u0026hellip; so sad\u0026hellip; but it is what it is, right?\nWell, I guess I am off for the day.

So I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to use it for a few days, but the next problem that has surfaced has been that some of the tact switches have been a bit finicky, and require multiple presses to get them to register a press on occasion. This is super annoying, and definitely slows down your workflow.\nAs a result, some of the tact switches on my MPC 500 haven\u0026rsquo;t all been working incredibly well. At some point they probably will need to be replaced, but for the time being I figured I\u0026rsquo;d try some Deoxit sprayed into the top of the switches to see if it might help.\nAbove you can see I popped the top of the case off, and boy is everything kind of dirty, the pads in particular stand out, but there is a lot of grunge around all of the buttons too. So here you can see I took off a fair number of the button caps, and let me tell you\u0026hellip; I took them all off and rinsed everything under water and wiped them down with a dry paper towel. There were a few strange colors that came off of some of the button caps, and I will try not to imagine what that was about.\nIn the above image it is kind of hard to see, but I basically got a drop of dioxin on every switch, and then I pushed each button for about 10-15 seconds to help work the Deoxit into the switch. After that I spent five minutes or so wiping the PCB board to make sure that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any left over Deoxit remaining on the PCB. While it may be fine, this poor MPC 500 has been through enough, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need extra debris and liquids floating around.\nIn this picture, I have begun to put it back together. You can also see that I had my Swiss Army knife out. I was using the bottle opener as a way to help push the clips in on the button caps to help release them from the PCB, since some of the spaces were a bit tight for my fingers.\nAll in all, this was a pretty quick job, and I\u0026rsquo;ll keep you posted on the results. While I was in here, I did spray some Deoxit into the Master and Record knobs, as well as the Q-link slider, and the data wheel. The Master and Record knobs seem to work a bit nicer, but the data wheel seems a bit tighter now. I may have to work the data wheel a bit more to break it in, or perhaps I\u0026rsquo;ve munged it up and now it will need to be replaced. I hope not, but stay tuned. I\u0026rsquo;ll also mention that the Play Start/Play/Record/Overdub/Stop buttons seem more responsive, but also perhaps a bit mushy.

I have most, if not all of the caps I need to do this job, but so far it still sounds pretty good from an input and output standpoint. I suspect most of the noise will go away if I get a power adapter, the batteries on the MPC 500 always seemed to generate a little noise for whatever reason\u0026hellip; so I\u0026rsquo;m not too worried about it so far.\nOne other note\u0026hellip; as I have been slowly cleaning the MPC 500 off, it still hasn\u0026rsquo;t lost the curry smell. it isn\u0026rsquo;t killing me or anything\u0026hellip; but it is absolutely noticeable.

To that end, you\u0026rsquo;ll hear some chops, but we were supposed to make sure that the original loops were still recognizable. So most of the loops get at least one straight play through at a minimum, generally with some EQ, before I started chopping them up, pitch shifting, and automating them through some effects.\nI then looked up the famous Sugar Free Gummy Bears review on Amazon, and asked Siri to kindly read out the review so I could drop it into the track. I dropped the overall track volume by -3db so that I could make the vox nice and fully forward, but I did get some feedback from folks that the music was a bit too low. After listening a few more times I tend to agree, though I did want that review front and center.\nI also got some feedback that perhaps the vox could be removed and I could just post the track.

Unfortunately she doesn\u0026rsquo;t really understand audio processing or audio file formats, so this kicked off a chain of unfortunate re-exports.

After time five, you\u0026rsquo;d think I would have learned my lesson. Which I did, but maybe not the one you\u0026rsquo;d think.\nI guess I will just dump a few thoughts and notes for somebody who might stumble upon this post, or to remind myself in the future in case I forget\u0026hellip;\nFirst, Amazon\u0026rsquo;s website for posting audio books is kind of a mess, and doesn\u0026rsquo;t exactly give the best information about some of the problems. The best example I will give is that I exported the audio files as mono 320kbps .mp3 files\u0026hellip; Ableton Live can only export to 320kbps for .mp3, and Amazon requires a minimum of 192kbps anyways. However, Amazon threw an error for the upload that the file was only 160kbps. Guess what, Amazon sees a 320kbps mono file as a 160kbps file, because apparently it doesn\u0026rsquo;t know the difference between mono and stereo. The fix was simple, just export the file as stereo, but it was a mono recording\u0026hellip; making it kind of a \u0026lsquo;dumb\u0026rsquo; fix.\nSecond, RMS was a problem, as it is the average volume of a file, and not the peak. This is fine, and why I was doing mild compression on my sister\u0026rsquo;s voice, but Amazon also requires that you don\u0026rsquo;t peak over -3db, so you cannot just normalize your audio, and instead need to process a bit differently. I forget all the intermediate tweaks, but I ultimately ended up adding a Push limiter from Ableton Live, and set the max value to -3db, which remediated the problem quite nicely, but as I said, was another round of processing.\nThird, my sister wanted to backing music to her intro and closing tracks, which was nice, but she wanted the music very quiet so that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t disturb her reading, and she didn\u0026rsquo;t want the music to be ducked by her speaking, since this was bound to sound weird to the listener. Oh, and she wanted only about 1/3 of the file to be spoken word. This hit the hardest RMS issue, and while I could have raised the volume, this isn\u0026rsquo;t what she wanted. So instead, I basically just started trimming the track from the start and end a bit, until we were able to fit within the RMS parameters, while also keeping the maximum volume below -3db.\nI guess the bad news is the entire investment of time was significantly higher than I had anticipated, but the good news is that I have a pretty good audio processing chain that I can use for my sister\u0026rsquo;s next audio book when she finishes her writing.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/06/audiobook-vocal-processing-pt-2/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell I just (hopefully) wrapped up the audio processing for my sister\u0026rsquo;s book.

In case you didn\u0026rsquo;t see it, I\u0026rsquo;ll post a picture below, but it was all jacked up. I suspect something heavy was dropped on it, or some other excessive amount of force. Maybe you can help decide?\nSo yeah, it was busted enough to snap the PCB in several places, and you can see where the metal frame got bent as well. Yesterday I picked up some Krazy Glue in preparation for the attempt for a big fix. I figured that particular glue would likely be the best way to hope to put the PCB back together as it does a really solid job bonding plastics. On the negative side, I am always getting this stuff stuck to my fingers and all over the place\u0026hellip; so I wasn\u0026rsquo;t exact thrilled to be working with it again.\nTo see if there was any hope, I ended up removing the PCB from the MPC, and a few parts kind of disintegrated, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too bad, the master volume and the record volume knobs where effectively the only two things holding the upper portion of the board together. This helped a bit because most of the parts stayed attached, but it was made a bit more difficult to get the glue where it needed to go because the knobs were either in the way or where holding parts of the PCB in awkward positions. I decided this was a more desirable situation than trying to desolder all of the knobs to get a better job holding everything together with the glue. Especially since the PCB was so warped already that I suspected it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter all that much.\nHere you can see me getting some of the supplies ready including the glue, and just taking a good look at the board. There were four major fractures on the PCB, and the important thing for me was to preserve the board since I could not get another one through MPC Stuff unfortunately, and also because this would at least need to function as a base for me to solder everything to. One thing you cannot see from these pictures is that almost all of the solder joints have torn away from the PCB, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what that means, well it means there is going to be a lot of soldering to do, since I cannot trust any of the bridges from the PCB to function since many of them were torn, and it is next to impossible to reattach the copper traces back to the PCB.\nBelow you can see what the PCB board looks like with everything glued back together. It is a bit janky still, but it is actually far more solid than I had anticipated. Fortunately none of the resistors were broken, and the trances to the resisters were at least all preserved. On the sad news, now that I could get a better look, you can see just how absolutely filthy the PCB is. I suspect it may be from excessive humidity, though I am not entirely sure. One thing I do know though, is that the device itself stinks like food\u0026hellip; possibly curry. I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to tear the MPC 500 apart and scrub there whole thing down. It\u0026rsquo;s not too much more work than I had intended anyways, since I was planning on stripping it down to replace the capacitors.\nSo I guess my take aways from the picture below, this thing is dirty as heck, and I had been hoping that I could bridge the PCB fractures with some small solder joints. At this point though, you can see what that huge gap, that is not going to happen. This is going to require running wire traces to replace all the broken joints, and unfortunately I don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to really test if any of the knobs are working\u0026hellip; the risk is that this could be a lot of work, and it still might fail.\nBelow is a picture after running most of the traces. This was probably three hours of work for me. Please note, I have not done much soldering in years, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a good wire stripper so I was making due with the Swiss Army knife. Yeah, it took longer, but I just kept plowing through.\nBelow shows me just hooking it up to test, without mounting it. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d run on batteries so I don\u0026rsquo;t accidentally electrocute myself, and it was a quick way to see if it worked. Good news everybody\u0026hellip; the left channel output worked, but strangely not the right channel. I also had a weird bug where I could hear the audio ins played directly through to the outputs. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what path I had accidentally bridged, but I thought to take a mental note that it could be useful in the future depending on how much hacking I want to do on this device. The other problem I had was that the left audio channel was the only input that seemed to be working as well. Presumably I really messed up the paths on both of the knobs to some degree.\nOverall I ended up having to pull it apart and I ended up testing all of the paths, and ended up finding out that about six of them were wrong\u0026hellip; whoops. I guess I should have read the traces from the board better. Unfortunately with the break it made it a little harder to read. I probably should have searched for a service manual, but I figured I was close enough that it was worth it to plow through further. One other problem I accidentally caused myself was that I removed two bridges from the knobs. Another oops\u0026hellip; and this made the knobs only work on one of the input and one of the output channels.\nSo after playing around a bit and getting everything to work it was time to screw it in and make sure that the case fit in properly and there weren\u0026rsquo;t any problems with my wires getting in the way. I had a few solder joints get loose and disconnect, probably cold joints, so I did have to redo the solder a few times.\nBelow you can see that the board is a little bit wiggly still, even though it is screwed into the case. I was concerned about screwing it in too tight, so I give it a tiny less than I would normally do when mounting one of these boards.\nThis last image shows that at least everything fits in properly\u0026hellip; \u0026lsquo;ish. It does work though, and while it was a really big time sync so far (all in probably five hours), at least it is working.\nNext up I think I\u0026rsquo;ll be recapping he audio related capacitors. It isn\u0026rsquo;t actually terribly noisy, but I know these tend to give out from previous experience, and I think while I have the time I will get the capacitors replaced. I\u0026rsquo;ve also got a few other fun goofy projects with the MPC 500, so I might try my hand at hacking and modifying it up a bit.\nStay tuned!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/03/akai-mpc-500-repair/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eSo a few days back I posted about picking up an \u003ca href=\"https://wordpress.com/block-editor/post/neartao.wordpress.com/620\"\u003eAkai MPC 500 on Reverb\u003c/a\u003e\u0026hellip; and it was absolutely a mess inside.

The rules were effectively to chop whatever, use your own drums, no external instruments, and you needed to drop a change up in the track. I\u0026rsquo;m interested to see what others do this week.\nSimilar to the MPC BB this week, I was really crunched for time to work on this. This time however I decided I would just do the track in the PO-33, and make it a quick flip. So I loaded the tracks into the MPC, but didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother chopping on the MPC, I just shuffled the starting point around the tracks and sampled in what ever I wanted to start or stop, and was able to get four or five interesting chops pretty quickly from the first track. For the second track, I just sampled roughly a loop, and let the auto chopper do it\u0026rsquo;s magic, or horrible destruction.\nFrom there, I did need some drums, and I sourced a pretty simple drum loop that had some movement in the sound just so I could change up the hits a little bit either over time or for the drops.\nTo build up the patterns, I mostly just built out 4 bar loops on the PO-33, copied them, and then made a version that had some effects. I did this for both sections of the song. Once I had this done, I really need to spend time working on the change up, because going from song one to song two was a bit of a mess. Sadly, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t really fix it up as much as I wanted, predominantly because of the limitations of the four note polyphony, I just could not have as many sounds playing at once as I wanted, which made it a bit awkward.\nAll into the song, I probably spent about 30-40 minutes. If I had more time, what I probably should have done was to create a drop track, and then a build up track. I did seriously consider this, but in the end, I figured what I had was good enough to put to use as a song. It\u0026rsquo;s not a winner, but hey, I\u0026rsquo;m still getting tracks together.

I was out RV\u0026rsquo;ing with my family and my parents for a couple of days over the weekend\u0026hellip; which held me up from having time to pull together more of a track. I was split on the track this week, and was messing around on Sunday afternoon on the MPC, and the yesterday I flipped to try to put a track together on the PO-33.\nI actually had some really good stuff happening on the PO-33, but it is very easy to accidentally change, delete, or otherwise mess up your sounds on the PO-33. There is not really any easy way to backup the device, without dumping the entire memory rather frequently. You can probably imagine where this is going\u0026hellip; but I accidentally deleted several of the sequences on the PO-33, and ended up just throwing my hands up last night. Today I figured I would just go back to what I had on the MPC and go from there.\nFrequently for the Beat Battles I have been skipping the mixing and mastering steps, and this time I decided I would spend my free time on leveraging the YA Mastering on the Akai MPC that I picked up a while back. This took me some time to wrap my head around, but honestly the instructions are pretty well explained, I think they could just be broken down a bit better without so much \u0026ldquo;refer back to section \u0026rdquo;. The sound was definitely punchier\u0026hellip; more so than I have gotten from most of the tracks I have tried to complete on the MPC only. I\u0026rsquo;ll definitely at least give the template a few more shots, and see if I can drop some A/B comparisons on what was put together.\nOverall to put this track together, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really do too much work sampling, I cut out what I thought sounded useful, did some EQ\u0026rsquo;ing, and really just focussed on one shots on the MPC. I had a few cool loops on the PO-33, but\u0026hellip; well that ship sank. For the drums, I just grabbed sounds out of some expansion content that I had sitting around, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything terribly fancy here either.\nAs per usual, I split the tracks out, and then made multiple sequences for sections of the song and used track mutes to build up the song. Something I haven\u0026rsquo;t done often, was convert the song back to a sequence, and then add some additional flourishes and sounds into the track to help add some more interest.\nAll in, I cannot recall how much time I put into this track, especially considering the PO-33 problems\u0026hellip; maybe I got a four hours into it, 2-3 on the MPC and maybe an hour on the PO-33. I am pretty happy with how the track came out, but I still think it could have used a bit more time spent on the mixing elements to get it to pop a bit better.

I also have to say, I cannot believe just how much prices have gone up over the last three months for a lot of this used gear. Yeah, I know it is not manufactured any more, and I know a lot of the stuff I have sold off people are now collecting for \u0026ldquo;that sound\u0026rdquo;, but yikes are the prices crazy. Is that a weird way to say \u0026ldquo;never been a better time to sell off used gear\u0026rdquo;, maybe?\nBefore I go into it though, my last piece of gear to sell is the Akai MPC 1000BK. I am happy it is going to somebody who is going to use it, but this piece of gear will absolutely be missed. With JJOS it has been a solid box, and I have thought several times about taking the listing down. On the other hand, I have absolutely had no reason to have three (was going to be FOUR) MPCs. Nope, I am not sequencing that much. So, I\u0026rsquo;ll miss you MPC 1k, we made a lot of great beats together, but it is time for you to go to a new home.\nWhat have I sold off recently?\nAkai MPC 1000BK - The X/Live workflow really got me, and just function that much better as an all in one solution. JJOS still has tricks up it\u0026rsquo;s sleeve that the 1k could do much more simply though. Power Conditioners - with selling off all of this gear, I don\u0026rsquo;t need quite so much power Korg Wavedrum - I really enjoyed this drum, it was super tactile and expressive, but it was really just getting dusty Korg Electribe 2 - While I enjoyed the sounds here, I am just too much into the MPC style of music production and the Electribe sounded great, but the sequencing felt limited Korg Electribe 2S - Similar to the other Electribe, but the sampling time was just too restrictive for my tastes. Moog FreqBox - I loved the sound FX here, but it just took up too much space for my needs\u0026hellip; Moog RingMod - Same as above, and I\u0026rsquo;ve replaced it to some extent with euro rack Moog 12-Stage Phaser - Same as above, and also effectively replaced with euro rack Critter \u0026amp; Guitari Organelle - Calm me a doofus, but I sold it to get the Organelle M. Oto Biscuit - I have so many 8 bit FX, and a lot of things emulate the Biscuit today\u0026hellip; I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t justify keeping it around\u0026hellip; I also cannot believe how much I sold it for. Akai S1000 8mb and 2x 2mb Memory Expansion - Upgraded my S1000 to 32mb on a single board, and was able to recoup *some* of the cost selling these boards off. Akai MPD32 - I just had no need for it, when I bought it (already had MPC) and it was sitting in the closet boxed up. Probably one of the few purchases I really regret. M-Audio Midisport 8x8 - As I have been simplifying the studio, I haven\u0026rsquo;t had as much a need for audio routing. Super happy to sell it to somebody who was using this as their studio centerpiece and it had imploded on them\u0026hellip; so mine was able to bring their studio back online quickly. Korg Kaossilator - a fun toy, but I just never got into it for making sounds. Akai APC40 - When I was heavy into Ableton Live, this was great\u0026hellip; I might consider getting a Push some day, but for now I\u0026rsquo;m not a heavy Ableton Live user. Korg MicroKorg XL - Great memories playing around with this, especially the vocoder, with my daughter. I felt a little bit bad selling it, especially since my daughter was not so much of a fan that I sold it. She has since forgiven me. Korg Kaoss Pad 2 - I really really liked this FX unit, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; it hadn\u0026rsquo;t fit into my workflow for years, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to upgrading. Devi Ever: Hymn Strangl Synth Mangler - Oddly, this had been purchased to be an FX unit thrown into the loop on my Moog Voyager. I never really used it, but it sounded great. Sold it for quite a bit, and I hope the new owner is shredding up epic guitar riffs. Flame Midi Talking Synth - At one point in my life\u0026hellip; I was going to write a program so that I could Speak n\u0026rsquo; Spell synthesize computer voice generated lyrics\u0026hellip; this project never happened, and while it was a fun little device to mess with, the amount I was able to sell it off for was insane. Akai MPC Live - I was rocking an MPC X, and had the Live\u0026hellip; and didn\u0026rsquo;t really need both. The X was a serious upgrade from the Live\u0026hellip; both from the amount of quick buttons, but also the 16 Q-Links is just great. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really need the Live anymore. Which currently leaves me with just the Moog Murf for sale. I have great memories tearing up loops with it, and will miss it when it goes, but it\u0026rsquo;s another one sitting in a box, just waiting to go out the door.\nI have to say, not having so much around to maintain and think about is nice. Even with what I have left sometimes it feels like a burden to just keep it working. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be selling off, donating, or otherwise getting rid of a few more things, but I also do feel like I am settling into what my core studio ought to be now. Once my last big piece of furniture comes in I\u0026rsquo;ll have to take a picture and start writing up more about what I am doing with it, what decisions and trade offs I\u0026rsquo;ve made, and figure out which few more pieces of gear go out the door.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/26/gear-i-have-sold-off-the-last-six-months/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am now down to one listing on Reverb to sell off\u0026hellip; which kind of feels insane to me, and got me thinking about what I have sold off over the years, and why I sold it off.

She just had her sixth birthday, so she deserves a little downtime now and then.\nWell, today I hit a longest move streak of 45 days. That is probably 40 more days than any of my previous move streaks. I will admit, there have been a few days in there where I just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to exercise. I had a late start, maybe got a mile into walking, and by the time I got home with the heat I just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to go out again.\nStaying motivated has come up a few times for me. A lot of this is because it is just very easy to say \u0026ldquo;what is one day?\u0026rdquo; I suppose I could make up for it the next day, or the day after, and that is both the point, and the issue.\nThe reality is true, the streak really doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter because it is not the goal. The goal I have for myself is to get into better shape. Taking a day off is not an impediment to that goal directly, but I have also spent time thinking that perhaps it is the symbol. I have mentioned before and will say it again, it has been several years since I have done any physical activity regularly.\nI used to hit the gym at work regularly, often three, but sometimes five days a week. That just about immediately ended when I decided to go back to school for my MBA about five years ago. Once I started my MBA, my life was consumed with getting everything out of it that I could, and as a result my personal life, my health, and my hobbies all took a back seat.\nWhen I completed the MBA last year, it took me about a month to even be able to have a normal relationship with my wife again because we had drifted pretty far apart. We had expected this, and gotten used to about four years of me going to school, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think we were prepared for how weird it would be to reconnect. With my hobbies taking a back seat, I also spent a lot of the last year trying to figure out what I wanted to do, as I have had many hobbies over the years, and I figured it was time to consolidate my interests.\nAll this is a long way to say both that I am happy that I am getting myself physically active again, and I am still working on pacing myself. It has been a long time coming, and oddly the pandemic has really helped me see the kind of spiral I was going down, just sitting at home, taking meetings, and not really moving much.\nI am going to keep ticking that move streak up, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to let it control my behavior either. What does that mean exactly? I am not sure, but for the time being I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep on getting out for walks, and I will start considering what other alternative exercises I can add to my repertoire.\nStay healthy!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/25/longest-move-streak/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe picture is of my dog Amy, she loves sun bathing after long walks.

On the MPC you really want to be thinking about One Shots (or Note On) for a sample, and for loops you frequently want to chop it up so you can flip the sample. Learn how to do trimming and chopping… while similar on Ableton in Simpler and Sampler… if you get into it you\u0026rsquo;ll also get a sense for what makes it different and creates a different sound.\nAbleton Drum Rack is pretty much equivalent to the MPC Drum Kit Program… and where I appreciate the MPC style more is in the space of leveraging 16 LEVEL and Q-Links… I don\u0026rsquo;t have a Ableton Push, but I imagine this feels similar in some ways. Ableton Sampler is pretty similar to MPC Key Group Programs… you can probably functionality think of them as similar as far as programming instruments and sounds go.\nI would suggest considering Ableton Clips as comparable to MPC Tracks. Though I will caution you… where a lot of folks tend to make mistakes is that they\u0026rsquo;ll create a drum program with lots of cool sounds, one shots, chords, fx, Vox, and such… and then just record everything onto a single Track. For practicing and playing around this is fine, but if you are trying to build a song you really want to think of each MPC Track as an Ableton Clip. Just like you typically do not want an Ableton Clip to have a full combination of your drums, bass, instrumentals, etc… in one clip most of the time, similarly you generally do not want to do this in an MPC Track either. Just be warned… you\u0026rsquo;re best to get in the habit of making each track Kick/Snare/Hat/Bass/Piano, or at least Drums/Bass/Lead… trust me, it will help you keep your sanity later on from having to Track -\u0026gt; Copy and then Erase events from each track… or having to do a Track Explode and then join things back together that are related.\nFinally… I\u0026rsquo;d highly suggest thinking of your Ableton Arrangement similarly to your MPC Sequence, in particular… consider that you want your MPC Tracks and Programs to be the same Sequence over Sequence (but maybe playing different patterns), because similar to Ableton Arrangement… it gets complicated to have Snares in your Hats Ableton lanes… and in particular on the MPC… things can get wonky.\nAll that said… these are all suggestions and gross over generalizations. Don\u0026rsquo;t feel like any of this is hard and fast, but just things to keep in mind when trying to learn how to think about the MPC with an Ableton mindset. None of this is set in stone, but there are things that are made easier to understand if you can grasp this.\nGood Luck!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/24/moving-from-ableton-live-to-an-mpc/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHere are some explanation I gave over at \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48\u0026amp;t=198904\u0026amp;p=1798905#p1798905\"\u003eMPC Forums\u003c/a\u003e to help explain how an MPC works if you\u0026rsquo;re coming from and Ableton Live environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI came from Ableton myself… and it\u0026rsquo;s a much different environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main things to get your head wrapped around on the MPC is sampling and sample management, programs (drums and key groups mostly), tracks and how to drop notes across various tracks to group things, and sequences to hold each section of your song.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Moving from Ableton Live to an MPC"},{"content":"New Beat Battle up at STBB Forever #694.

This week\u0026rsquo;s challenge is to use an instrumental style track, and to make a trap beat, with a boom bap build up. I\u0026rsquo;m not terribly familiar with making trap beats, but I know the genre well enough to give it a go. Besides, trap is what dark vibes, ratchets, whoa/yeah/what shoutouts, and is pretty diverse BPM wise. I guess I forgot the shoutouts on my track though, so at least one mistake. Or was it? No, I forgot to put in some murmurs, shout outs, etc\u0026hellip; but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m going back to update the track.\nInstead of trying to cap myself off at the 60-90 minute mark, I figured with it being a nice Father\u0026rsquo;s Day weekend I\u0026rsquo;d go for closer to three or four hours. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure exactly where I landed in there\u0026hellip; but I did spend more time on this track than a lot of previous beat battles.\nI got most of the initial chopping done on Saturday, and then spent some time playing around with getting a kit together for the trap sounds. From there I really just messed around with trap sounding patterns until I had something that I felt was livable\u0026hellip; and could then bounce off of and layer the chops off of.\nOnce I got that settled\u0026hellip; I programmed in what I figured would make a good boom bap drum track using the same kit\u0026hellip; and oops\u0026hellip; I forgot that I had my trap BPM at 160, not 80\u0026hellip; so the boom bap drums played double time. Not a sucker to waste anything though, I decided to make a copy and then use the track function to cut the track speed in half. A curious note when doing this\u0026hellip; the MPC Live does not appear to move any automation\u0026hellip; because that seems to have stuck around. Weird that the notes move, but that the automation track stays at the same speed. Is this a feature or a bug? Definitely a bug, but something I suppose could be abused by those who take note and work it out.\nGetting through the boom bap drums, I then went back and made some more variations using the chops. This worked well and good, getting me some fun sounds, but definitely not dark enough. I ended up fiddling with a few other attempts, and think I got a few tracks darker, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t really feel trap dark to me. Whatever that might mean\u0026hellip;. *shrug*.\nSo the biggest problem I landed on with this track, was that I really lost patience trying to put this together on the MPC. It just did not want to play nicely at a certain point because I had too many programs, automation tracks and other things going on, that I could not nicely explode the pad hits into unique tracks that I could then mute and unmute like I normally would.\nThis drove me into loading up Ableton Live, and hooking the MPC up in controller mode to be able to record off the loops. It worked okay, but it was a fair bit of time spent monkeying with recording content that could have been better served mastering the track. However, a nice side effect of dropping this off into Ableton was that I could use the visual spectrum and eight eq mixing to get a better sense for what was going on in the audio field in a way you just cannot do with the MPC in standalone (at least right now).\nIf you look at the waveform data you\u0026rsquo;ll definitely see that it is rather \u0026ldquo;quiet\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; whether you like this or not\u0026hellip; well it tends to mean that there is more dynamic range, but that it also doesn\u0026rsquo;t compete with similar tracks that will have a better mix and mastering.

Over the years I have been on many services including iMessage, ICQ, AOL Messenger, Google Chat, WhatsApp, Telegram, IRC, Slack, and many more. There are in fact so many messaging applications, that I am not going to bother to list them all.\nSure, you can load all of the local apps, but anybody who has tried doing this knows that you end up with a mess in your taskbar, and worse, trying to mute messages can be a real chore when you are in a meeting because you may have 10+ services that need to be silenced.\nAbout two years ago I checked out Franz based on a some co-worker\u0026rsquo;s suggestions, and beyond having to wait for a \u0026ldquo;please pay\u0026rdquo; time out, it worked well. It can be used for free, but I ended up bouncing off of it for a few reasons. First, I have no problem paying a one time fee for something, but I have a gut reaction to monthly fees, I just don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay them. Sure I get that it may cost less than a cup of coffee, I have heard that argument many times (and probably made it myself in the past). For me though, I just don\u0026rsquo;t like coffee, and I don\u0026rsquo;t care to pay for any more monthly fees than I have to. So if you want my money, please make it a one time payment. Second, the platform became somewhat unstable and stopped supporting some of the services that worked previously. I have read that Franz is somewhat unsupported, which may or may not be true, but for what is effectively a browser wrapped into a client, it really needs to work better than just using the browser in the first place.\nOnce Franz stopped meeting my needs, I did consider looking back into Trillian (I don\u0026rsquo;t believe this is supported on OS X, but may look into it again), just using the browser, and both Rambox and Station popped up on my radar.\nRambox looks to work very similar to Franz, so I gave it a look, but unfortunately it also has a monthly subscription for it\u0026rsquo;s Pro use. I have read that if you do not go pro it only supports three client tabs\u0026hellip; which if I only needed three clients I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be looking for a management system in the first place. Again, I don\u0026rsquo;t know if this is true, but definitely something to look into if this looks to be something you are interested in.\nStation has been what I have settled on for the last few months. It worked well enough out of the box that I deleted Franz almost immediately. The client setup and overall interface is pretty clean, and you can configure quite a lot. It also allows you to load multiple accounts of the same service on different pages, which is very important if, like me, you have both personal and work accounts of the same products. Most important to me, it has been quite stable for me, and I have not (yet) had any issues with services no longer being supported.\nAll that said, Station hasn\u0026rsquo;t been all roses for me. I\u0026rsquo;m not exactly excited about how much memory it uses, and on my older MacBook Pro, every MB of memory does count sometimes, especially during self isolation and quarantine where I am forced to have all these clients open, video conferencing software running, and all the other software necessary to keep working. A small nit pick, but the application doesn\u0026rsquo;t load the client page until you open many of them. Which results in me frequently loading up the slack page, only to find out it was not running for a few days and I have a backlog of messages to respond to.

The oldest pooch Amy continues to be super stubborn. The first eighth of a mile she just stops. Today I took a picture.\nNo more walks dad!\nI have tried a couple of tactics to change this behavior, and so far have not had any success.\nTreats\nAmy absolutely loves snacks, to the point that we\u0026rsquo;ve had to keep an eye on her diet enough to ensure she doesn\u0026rsquo;t turn into a foot rest. We\u0026rsquo;ve kept her around twenty pounds for several years now, but she was about twenty five pounds a while bag. She just loves food, and knows how to beg for it.\nHowever, food has not been a great motivator to teach her new skills or motivate her to take specific actions. She is getting older, and it is easy to think she is just getting stubborn in her ways. That said, the biggest problem with bringing treats on a walk is that it becomes a giant distraction for her, with her trying to jump up to my hand or paw at the pocket that has the food she wants so badly.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been concerned that with the treats, she is so focussed on the food that she really isn\u0026rsquo;t paying attention to where we are going, which would be okay, but she also doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to where she is going. This has been to the point of me worrying about her getting caught up in her leash and her sister\u0026rsquo;s leash, tripping over things, and possibly leading to a serious injury.\nWaiting\nAnother tactic I have tried is when I feel the leash go taught to just wait for her to come to me. She never does this, and if I give her some slack she will immediately turn herself around and start pulling to go back home. I do not have all day to wait for her on the end of a taught leash to move forward, and Amy is super patient.\nSo yeah, I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to wait, and as a side effect to waiting, or other dog Zoe gets super agitated waiting as she wants to continue the walk, leading to her running around and nipping her older sister. While this might not be an immediate problem, I also haven\u0026rsquo;t wanted this to cause problems between the two dogs.\nPlow Ahead\nI have tried the tactic of walking fast enough that Amy doesn\u0026rsquo;t really get the chance to dig in her heals to stop, and it does cause her to become a bit of a drag, which I suppose could be good from an exercise standpoint for me, I have been concerned about stretching or pulling her neck when using a leash attached to her collar.\nCertainly I do not want to cause any long term damage to her, and while this has caused her to keep up better, it also makes it harder for me to keep tabs on her when she has to stop to go to the bathroom. Overall I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s not a great strategy, and I would not suggest it, at least while leased to the collar. We do have body harnesses, and as I type this up I am reminding myself to give this a bit more of a try while she is leashed with the body harness.\nAlternate Route\nBy far this has been the best strategy, just to take her on walks that take her through areas that she is unfamiliar with. Amy is a very stubborn dog, and she does not like things to change too much. The good news is that once I get her onto a new path, she is happy to just follow along and really only stops to go to the bathroom. The bad news is that she knows the area around our neighborhood pretty well, and we have to keep doing wider and wider circuits so that she does not know exactly where she is until we are ready to get her on her way back.\nSince I have been working to spend more time exercising and getting outdoors though, this has lined up pretty well with my own personal goals. I can tell you, I am definitely getting to know my neighborhood more intimately by walking side streets and areas I hadn\u0026rsquo;t bothered to explore before.\nSummary\nFor me, taking alternate routes to walk around the neighborhood has been the best for myself and for my dogs. You might wonder why I am going through all this trouble, and the answer is to get us all healthier. My goal has been to get both of the dogs at least a mile of walking in a day, and it has really helped them a lot by giving them more energy and raising their attentiveness levels. They both do love being outside, it is just getting Amy moving in the right direction that has been a little challenging.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/20/walking-the-dogs/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve still been taking the dogs out on walks with me, and trying to get both of them at least a mile a day.

She\u0026rsquo;s been looking to expand out into the audio book space, which makes sense to me!\nShe had been looking into some voice actors who could read the book. When I heard the audio quality of the demo, it was rather poor. We were hoping that it was just a quick demo, but it suffered from a lot of background noise. My sister passed on links to the voice actor, and the demo\u0026rsquo;s she had on her website were great. After I gave my sister a few questions to ask and suggestions for contract negotiations, unfortunately it fell through. We suspect that the voice actor recorded her website demo at a professional studio, and likely recorded the demo she produced for my sister at home. Total bummer, but it\u0026rsquo;s better to both live and learn, and get through these miss steps early is what I always say.\nThis lead somewhat naturally into a conversation with my sister about how she could do this recording work herself. I warned her that the deeper you dig, the more picky you get, and that it can turn into a budgetary sinkhole, but so far she\u0026rsquo;s been digging into figuring out how to get this going herself.\nShe pretty quickly knocked out the reading of her first chapter, and did it on her Apple Headphones, and honestly, I was shocked at how decent the audio quality sounded, especially since she has had little to no experience in voice recording, and honestly I always thought the Apple headphones were okay at best. I ended up helping her out with some additional de-essing, eq\u0026rsquo;ing, compression, and reverb for some post treatment, and at first she seemed pretty happy. (Un)Fortunately she listened to her audio tracks, and compared them to what she heard other amateur audio book recordings sounded like. She pretty much immediately picked out a lot of qualities she didn\u0026rsquo;t like in these other amateur recordings, and then quickly realized she had a lot of the same problems in her recording.\nThis put her back to the drawing board, and I ended up discussing with her about microphones, recording technology, audio processing technology, as well as vocal speaking and positioning techniques. Do not misconstrue and of this that I know what I am talking about, I just know enough to be dangerous, and at least get her into the top rung of the amateur level, but I doubt I\u0026rsquo;d be able to compete very well even at the bottom of the professional level.\nFrom here, she decided to pick up a Blue microphone. I am pretty sure she picked up the [Blue Yeti](http://Blue Microphones Yeti Studio Blackout USB Condenser Microphone), though I\u0026rsquo;ll have to ask her to be sure. Likely because this was the easiest way for her to hook it up to the computer without having to go through the hassle of using a pre-amp, converting the line audio to a digital format that the computer can understand. I am absolutely guessing here though. Once she got a few tracks recorded, she reached out to talk to me about whether her breaths were too heavy. They were very noticeable! Not super loud, but as anybody who\u0026rsquo;s done vocal recording knows, the closer you are to the microphone to get a good audio level and presence, the louder all your mouth sounds such as plosives are. She was using Audacity to process her vocals, and I think she spent some time removing the breathing and mouth sounds by hand. If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever done this before, you know how much work that is!\nSo oops\u0026hellip; but we ended up talking about de breather plugins, and she was definitely interested in the Waves Debreath. I looked into the description with her, and it sounded like what it said \u0026ldquo;on the tin\u0026rdquo; as it were is what she was looking for. Fortunately this plugin worked for her in Audacity to do the vocal processing without having to deal with any further hassle.\nShe doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of the software or hardware I have, so she\u0026rsquo;s been asking me to put together some audio processing chains together. I have some hardware compressors I was thinking of using, but honestly I just used the chain I put together in Ableton Live, and reprocessed it. My sister was asking how it was going for me, and I told her the most time consuming part for me was just visually adjusting the audio levels for the clip, to which she decided to record her microphone at a higher level. This made the compressor work better without having to normalize the clip, and seems to have had no negative side effect on the noise floor post processing.\nOne thing we played around with was the reverb, and I had been using about 9% wet, but this was too much for her taste. I dropped it down to 6%, and she felt it was still too much. We\u0026rsquo;ve settled on about 3% wet reverb, which is just enough to add some presence to the audio, but you hardly hear the difference.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll keep some updates going in the future for how things progress, but for now my sister is happy with the process, the amount of work, and the overall quality of the output.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in the signal chain, feel free to ask. I may take some time in the future to write it up a bit more and possibly provide the project file that I have put together.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/19/audio-book-vocal-processing/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy sister has released the book \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SOMNIUM-Beyond-Darkness-D-Sterling-ebook/dp/B087T5TVSS#ace-g1639449406\"\u003eSOMNIUM Beyond the Darkness\u003c/a\u003e on Amazon as a kindle book and as a paperback book, which is an excellent read for young adults and adults alike.

Two weeks ago I was complaining about just feeling sore everywhere, and now I feel sore in just a few muscles when I push myself for walks.

Not sure that I\u0026rsquo;ll dive deep into the STBB community and beat battles or not, but it\u0026rsquo;s fun to find some other communities and see what may or may not stick with you.\nFor the STBB #693 track, there was a *lot* of content to parse through, and there was a lot that would absolutely trip up on a submission to YouTube or Soundcloud. So, who knows how long my submission will last, but it is posted for now. The rules were pretty simple, use something from every track, no snares on 2 or 4, and something about being able to used instruments, but no sampled melodic content. I decided to just use all of the content just from the tracks, that\u0026rsquo;s been most of my style lately, and it makes it more of a fun challenge to see what you can squeeze out.\nWell, I listened to almost all of the content, and just scrubbed through it while I sat outside and enjoyed the breeze. I found a handful of sounds that inspired me, so I cut exported them into some samples for future processing. I think I grabbed fourteen samples total, really all just one shots, and the sound I used as a crash got EQ\u0026rsquo;d into both an open and closed high hat. Honestly, nothing really tricky going on.\nSome of the other samples I grabbed however, were just too noisy, and needed some taming through low pass and high pass filters, and some judicious use of effects. One sound in particular I gave some delay, reverb, and gating treatment to make it more synth pop\u0026rsquo;ish. I spent a little time trying to mix the levels of clips, but honestly not enough to really balance and polish things up. I was really trying to hit a two hour time max, so it didn\u0026rsquo;t really leave much time from the start to get to arrangements.\nIf I am being honest with myself, this has been a big downfall for my BB submissions, and maybe I should just commit to spending more time, but I still hold out hope I can streamline my process to get faster.\nAnyway, once I had a bunch of different samples looping over some four bar tracks, I figured it was time to start making different sequences on the MPC, which I did, to epic failure, which consumed a lot of time. Instead of doing Track Mutes, I accidentally did a whole bunch of sequences with Pad Mutes\u0026hellip; which follow sequences. I know this, I know this, I know this\u0026hellip; but it just completely passed my mind.\nSo\u0026hellip; I had to redo all the work, by breaking up my single track into multiple tracks. Yeah\u0026hellip; it soaked up precious time I could have used in other places, but now lost probably 15 minutes breaking the one track into several tracks. Before you suggest I use the explode function, which I absolutely could have, I did it by hand, this was my punishment for making this mistake. I do need to break myself of the habit I have fallen back into for not just recording everything on separate tracks. Plus to be fair, a good amount of time was spent just renaming things so I could find may way around faster afterwards.\nFrom here, I was able to flip to different sequence sections, and name them appropriately so that I could put something together in song mode. What you hear below is what I was able to put together in roughly fifteen to twenty minutes of arrangement time. There are a few sections I\u0026rsquo;d like to tweak, but honestly it\u0026rsquo;s the mixing that would have offered more improvement, followed by at least one pass to give it some mastering spin.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/stbb-693-down-with-it\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/17/track-stbb-forever-bb-693/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell I rushed my \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com\"\u003eMPC Forums\u003c/a\u003e beat battle submission, and ended up deciding to post a track to \u003ca href=\"https://stbbforever.com/index.php\"\u003eSTBB Forever\u003c/a\u003e this time.

There are certainly wrong ways to approach it, but don\u0026rsquo;t let anybody fool you by saying they know \u0026ldquo;the one way\u0026rdquo;.\nFor a beat battle, the two most important things are to familiarize yourself with the rules, and familiarize yourself with the samples. These two things will likely be the most important for setting your direction and where you want to experiment or challenge yourself, and knowing where you can safely stick to basics.\nThe following will likely make more sense for MPC X/Live/One users due to terminology\u0026hellip; though much of it applies to other MPCs, DAWs, and what have you.\nChopping Samples\nOne of the most important things to do is to listen to the sample, and determine what you like, and what you think you can pull out. Listening for isolated drum hits, vocals, instruments, and all that\u0026hellip; this will give you what will be the easiest building blocks to work with. Sure, you can EQ and filter out sounds, but it can also make some of the sounds muddy. For me this is usually one of the first steps, and I\u0026rsquo;ll just go to sample mode and keep moving the start marker and playing the sample to see where I can hear and extract clean or relatively clean hits.\nChopping Loops\nWhile listening for samples, I often have a notebook and will jot down start markers for interest loops from the audio. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re lucky and can get a breakbeat or instrument solo, and sometimes there are quite workable mixed loops. I\u0026rsquo;ll go through these and tend to set start/end markers with looping on and listen for 1/2/4/8 bar loops. It\u0026rsquo;s great when they loop perfectly, but sometimes you just don\u0026rsquo;t get so lucky. Once I\u0026rsquo;ve extracted the loops, one way I will use them is to set the chop mode to regions and try and depending on the sound have enough regions for 1/8 note, 1/4 note, or whatever happens to work.\nDrum Pattern\nUsually I\u0026rsquo;ll try and use drum hits I have extracted to create a rudimentary drum pattern. It really doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be fancy, but just something you feel you can jam to. Sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll use the above chopped loops for reference to use the same tempo, but usually I don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it too much. The tempo is often dictated by my energy level when I kick off the project.\nLoop Tempo Alignment\nRemember how I said I don\u0026rsquo;t care about the tempo? Well, it can make it so loops sound janky because if you play them out they will either stutter, or they will be cut off too short. This *can* sound cool, but if you want to reasonably line them up to roughly play at the same speed, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to tweak something. That something for me is regularly the pitch that the loop chops play at. For me, what I do is load up the pattern into a new track and just knock out a01, a02 \u0026hellip; a16 for example, at the appropriate tempo of the drums, regardless if it is too fast or too slow. Then I play the loop to the looped region and go to Program Master, and change the master pitch for the Loop program so that you don\u0026rsquo;t hear any silence or harsh overlaps. Again, this is trial and error, and sometimes it will sound great being janky\u0026hellip; so just play around. If you want to keep the rest of the loops in key, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to do similar semitone changes to your other chopped loops, and possibly to your single hits as well. It all depends on the sound you are aiming for.\nI could keep going, but let me know if this is a good start for you?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/12/beat-battle-workflow/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are at least as many workflows as there are people doing it.

That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that everybody else will like it, but it can be important to go with your gut. While chopping with a GUI sure is handy, it also can lead to some very \u0026lsquo;same\u0026rsquo; chops. So if a chop that is early or late works for you, does not mean it is wrong.\nThis next one is harder, because a lot of music gets our ears warmed to \u0026ldquo;on the grid\u0026rdquo;, but I would also say don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to turn timing correct off, play, and see what you get. There can be real magic to be found when you are not always on the grid, and seriously, human drummers are never 100% on the grid. An extreme of this is to track straight to audio, it is super frustrating at first, but it can really open up a world of possibilities in timing you had never known of. For this reason, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important for everybody to have at least some experience with a looper of some sort. Similar to MPC 2/4/8 bar tracks, a looper can get you to lay out a pretty complete idea in short order. Better, if it can sync to midi you can use the two together and just go bananas.\nIf you want to sound authentic it is important to study what great drummers do, and how they do it. This requires listening to music, and don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to listen to the same song multiple times. Each listen can help you understand some nuances that you might not have heard before. Obviously it is easier to process a break, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t always mean it is the best part of the song to gravitate to, because the way the drums interact/groove/swing/etc with the rest of the music can help you learn new ideas and concepts.\nLast point I\u0026rsquo;ll add here is don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to go way outside the box. Sample sources don\u0026rsquo;t need to be records or songs, why not beat box, make a recording session trying weird sounds with an empty water bottle, sample yourself beating the hell out of a garbage can. This is probably super obvious for a lot of you, but don\u0026rsquo;t be afraid to pitch to extremes, you never know what kind of sounds you\u0026rsquo;ll find, a short sound bite from tapping a glass with a spoon could sound like an epic drum hit detuned -24… you just never know.\nI\u0026rsquo;m just leaving this here… because if this cannot help inspire you, I don\u0026rsquo;t know what will. https://www.thefutzbutler.com/news/the-20-best-drum-sounds-of-all-time/\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/09/sampling-drum-techniques/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis was a response I had for Danoc on the MPC Forums thread \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48\u0026amp;t=198461\"\u003eDrum Techniques 4 Da MPC\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m going to lead off with \u0026ldquo;if it sounds good, it is good\u0026rdquo;.

I am far more used to producing something from components that I have control over, and working with fully mixed content and chopping it up is not very familiar territory for me.\nThe biggest difficulty that I had was that I wanted to change up the drum progressions after I had copied the sequence 10 times. I came to realize that in the MPC X, standalone mode doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have a way to copy a track to a different sequence. My work around for this was to copy and paste, which created a lot of manual work. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t impossible to work out, but it definitely was far more fiddly than I would have liked for a workflow. Perhaps people don\u0026rsquo;t get hung out with this too much, but it did seem sub optimal to me.\nKeep on dropping tracks!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/08/track-mpc-forums-bb-280/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe beat battle is active for another couple days, if you\u0026rsquo;re interested check it out at \u003ca href=\"https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40\u0026amp;t=198305\u0026amp;start=15\"\u003eBB 280\u003c/a\u003e.

The rings are Move - 740 calories, Exercise - 30 minutes, and Stand - 12 hours. I\u0026rsquo;ve found a roughly two to three mile walk will get me there for the day, and takes me about 30-40 minutes to complete. I can also hit the Calories goal with about twenty minutes of running, but that has been a bit rougher for me. My allergies kick in, and I have work induced asthma. I\u0026rsquo;ll work through it better in the future, but as it has warmed up and gotten more humid outside, I haven\u0026rsquo;t really wanted to run.\nI am still really just focussed on creating good habits for myself, and not trying to challenge my younger self. I have especially found that where I used to be for running is long gone. I realize that I am not in my twenties anymore, but my goodness was it a shock going up a relatively reasonable uphill slope. It was much harder than I remember and really took my breath away quickly.\nFor now I am happy to keep going out for walks, and otherwise using the rowing machine as a backup for when it is not great weather outside. It is unlikely that the walking is helping me too much with stamina, but I figure it will help me build up a bit of a base and get my body used to raising my heart rate through a fast paced walk before I try to get back to jogging and running. Besides, from all this walking I am embarrassingly sore through a lot of my body, but in particular my legs are feeling the burn. I just keep reminding myself two things, this won\u0026rsquo;t last forever and it is part of the process to get my body into a respectable shape. I have absolutely gone from no exercise to heavy exercise in the past, and just given up. My goal is to not give up so I have to accept this slower pace and commitment to making the time. Plus, when my wife has been available it has been a great opportunity to spend some time together that we may not otherwise have.\nIf anybody else out there is considering getting back into any kind of physical activity routine, my advice is to just do it. The hardest start was actually breaking my behaviors that created feedback behaviors with my family. As I mentioned a few weeks ago I would ask if anybody wanted to walk with me, and then would get a lot of \u0026ldquo;I will be ready in five minutes\u0026rdquo; or similar, which reduced my time to walk, or put an easy wall to stop because by the time the family member was ready to go, I was out of time.\nInstead, I am now announcing \u0026ldquo;I am going for a walk in thirty minutes\u0026rdquo;, or letting my family know \u0026ldquo;I am going for a walk now\u0026rdquo;, and if they are able to join me or can make it happen it is great, but otherwise they have now learned when I am ready to go, I am going. I am not giving myself the choice to hold back for much more than thirty seconds, and it has really helped me get out the door.\nGood luck, and get yourself out there!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/06/04/still-streaking/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI hit twenty four days of closing the workout rings on my Apple Watch in a row yesterday.

Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll post them. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in seeing some of the discussion and submissions check out the MPC Forums BB 279 Thread. There\u0026rsquo;s definitely a lot of good content there, and some really great flips.\nMy approach has been to just spend 60-90 minutes on each battle, so instead of trying to get a full track or perfect mix, just go for speed of getting something workable and putting it together quickly. This battle was no different, and while I\u0026rsquo;m not excited for the track exactly, it was fun.\nDanoc provided the track from Diana Ross \u0026ldquo;Ain\u0026rsquo;t No Mountain High Enough\u0026rdquo;, which is an excellent track on its own, with plenty of material to pull from no matter how you want you want to approach it. My approach was to listen to the track a few times and take some notes and pull some hits/loops. Initially I was considering taking some full on portions of the song and mixing them, but what I ended up gravitating to was some of the bass note hits I could isolate, the strings were pretty easy to grab at the start, and I was able to almost get a few isolated hits out of the break.\nBeyond that, I found some pretty easy to sample vocal loops both with and without drums that looped well. In the end though, I just chopped the vocals to be just usable enough without having to EQ or try other tricks to get it to extract well. There was a bit of a fight with some of the reverb tails, but when you settled the vocal hits into the mix it was hardly an issue.\nI tried, tried, tried to get a kick out of it, but I ended up making mostly a bassy hit, which is pretty prominent in the track, but I had to go through my sample library to source a complimentary kick and layer them to get more impact.\nI was initially aiming for a 96bpm mix, but I wanted to make it a bit darker, and ended up dropping the Diana Ross clips by 3 semitones. It sounded much darker, but also (as you\u0026rsquo;ll know if you\u0026rsquo;ve done this) had the sound effect of making the length of all of the hits go longer, so to solve this I dropped the BPM until it sounded good. This ended up with a track speed of 75bpm.\nThe next step was to find a vocal rap, and this is where I found Eminem 3 a.m. would fit in nicely. I loaded up Spleeter to get the vocal track as best I could. As I mentioned before, it totally has that spectralness to it that sounds weird, but I was hoping settling it into the mix it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too obvious. I guess see for yourself what you think. Instead of focusing on dropping the full rap in, I just grabbed out to main sections, and then grabbed some of the intro vocals to mix throughout and then dropped it into a song.\nTo make the intro, main, and outro I didn\u0026rsquo;t really doing anything magical, it was just removing a few sections to make it sound like a build up and drop, but it was the lazy version. I definitely could have orchestrated things better, but I was running out of time, and didn\u0026rsquo;t even spend much time mixing, and definitely did not get to mastering.\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;m happy with my output, but there are some really good tracks dropped in the forum.

To skip a day or two is not that bad, especially when I go back and check out my move data from the last two years. I think I broke my move streak of what was three, or maybe it was five for the first time this month. Sure, it is a little sad that I had not been consistently exercising, but it is what I am doing today that is important.\nOn the other hand though, I am definitely not used to all of this activity and I can feel it in my muscles. My legs in particular have a pretty constant dull ache, and I am having to take some time to stretch throughout the day, otherwise I feel like everything is tightening up. This is progress though, and while I still haven’t really lost any weight, I can say that I am sleeping better.\nI mentioned last week that I was having problems getting one of my dogs to walk. I’ve continued to take them out for walks, and I am making sure that they are getting at least a mile in a day. Some of the recent days have been pretty warm, so I am starting to get them an early morning 6am walk first thing in the morning before it really gets hot. This has been a little troublesome, since the dogs are used to eating first thing after they got up. My hope is that since they are creatures of habit, if I can just be consistent that it will correct itself over time.\nAt this point, I am managing about 3 miles of walking/running in a day, which is enough to get my all three rings closed. I also have a rowing machine that is my backup, so that if it gets too hot out or the air quality goes down and makes it hard to breath, I have something to keep me active.\nFor anybody else who is thinking of getting back to exercising, here are my suggestions and considerations for you.\nStart your exercising earlier in the day, it makes it easier to reach your goals Set a realistic goal you can hit every day Involve others (friends/family/pets) in the activities to create a support system Come up with more than one activity Break up the routine throughout the day For any of you looking to get started, just remember to stay active! Now I am off for my next mile walk.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/05/30/keeping-motivated-exercising/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have hit 20 consecutive days now of closing all three rings on my Apple Watch, and I am wondering how much further I will go.

How the MPC X handles clips is close to what I need, especially compared to how previous versions handled clips\u0026hellip; but I have to say, it is not quite there.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve got two main problems with how the MPC X handles clips. The first problem is that the looper cannot be used in real time in many instances, because you are forced to take audio off of your inputs (mostly fine) or resampling (not really fine). Resampling means that you\u0026rsquo;ve got to take a break in your workflow if you want to resample something you are doing live while running other audio. The other problem I hit was that when you export the loop from audio to a sample, when you assign it in clip mode, it does some kind of strange BPM timing\u0026hellip; and this almost never matched what the project I was working on. Although my project was 96bpm, it would just assume what seemed like a random BPM 90% of the time, and with warping on it would sound like hot stretched garbage, even with the Pro Ten warping turned on. This is a big bummer and doesn\u0026rsquo;t bode well for using the MPC X as something you could use in a live environment.\nThe drums come in courtesy of the Pocket Operator Tonic, and pretty much seeded this track. I sampled a full 16 pads, but I think I really only used 7 or 8 of the sounds, and nothing fancy for 16 level or other tricks here, just a straight up beat this time around.\nThe bass and lead sounds I created from the Access Virus Dark Star, and I played quite a few patterns to see what I liked. There is probably enough to make a whole other song or two, but for now it is saved off in this project. I only used 5 loops created from this, and the song plugs along without a whole lot of variety.\nThe vocals are all me, sampling into the Pocket Operator Speak, on fx 7, and dropping the tone of the content by 8 semitones. I was going for a more computer synthesized set of audio, and it definitely gave that effect. The vocals are \u0026ldquo;Yo that sounds dope get real live high\u0026rdquo; and chopped up into the MPC X to give the audio components. I had thought about pitching the vocals around, and I ought to have for some more variety, but I ran out of steam for this project.\nThe grand total of clips are 2 drum loops, 2 bass loops, 3 lead loops, and 2 vocal loops that make up this song. Honestly, I could have finished this within the MPC, but I ended up bringing it into Ableton Live just to audition the clips and track them out faster. I will probably go back and take a stab at doing it all within the MPC X at some point, but I also just wanted to finish this track. While it might suffer from it a bit, I\u0026rsquo;m also trying to focus on just completing at least a quarter of the tracks I get started, and I have a large backlog of started, but unfinished tracks.\nhttps://youtu.be/Qpc2ScQwn80\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/05/29/track-live-high/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis track started life on the MPC X, and I did everything I could to try and use Clip mode to create loops.

To put it nicely the previous owner seems to have let it go, and maintenance was not on the forefront of their mind. Not a big problem per se, but the box it arrived in was a mess, and it was very poorly packed. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that this S1000 had seen much love in a long time.\nOne of the problems that it has had since I picked up was a very, very, very, noisy rec gain knob, that when you turned it would make a lot of noise and static. This is a common problem on older gear, the material oxidizes and then there is not a consistent signal flow which causes this noisy sound when turning the knob.\nThere are a few ways to try and repair it. The first would be to do a complete replace of the potentiometer, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t up for taking the whole S1000 apart and doing all of the necessary soldering work. Instead I decided to take it apart just enough to spray some Deoxit into the back of the potentiometer.\nBefore getting started, I disconnected everything from power. I had to take off the face panel, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t too hard but getting the angle right on the spray was a bit tricky. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t too much work, but it required taking notes down as I pulled it apart so that I knew where parts came from and where they needed to go. As you can see, with the volume/gain knows, they are a bit further down in the chassis. This makes it a bit harder to get the Deoxit spray into the back of the potentiometer to deoxidize it.\nOnce you spray the Deoxit in there, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to turn the knob back and forth for a while to help get the material in there to do the deoxidation magic. I\u0026rsquo;d say about 60 seconds is good and enough time to help let it dry, but definitely read the directions on your can to see what it says. Also\u0026hellip; as with many things, a little bit will go a long way, so don\u0026rsquo;t try and fill up that port with Deoxit.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t taken too much apart, I would try and plug the device back in carefully and see how well it works before you put everything back together, because otherwise you might be needing to take it all apart again, to do the job a second time.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/05/26/akai-s1000-record-knob-repair/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI have been working on restoring an Akai S1000 that I picked up on eBay, and it has needed some help.

It\u0026rsquo;s nothing too fancy, but it can be a quick way to get a strike gate on the RxMx and generating sounds. The Morphagene is doing some pad type duty of a piano chord I recorded, and then moving the pitch around and then driving in through Magneto to get some screwy tape delay effects. From here\u0026hellip; the Magento output is going into Mimeophone, which is then adding some additional space/depth to the pad. The Assimil8r is driving the main drum sounds, using the built in 808 effects. This is being sequenced by Pamela\u0026rsquo;s New Workout\u0026hellip; which is effectively just mapped to output a pretty standard house four on the floor kick, snare, and hat\u0026hellip; by just changing the gate speeds.

Here\u0026rsquo;s the video I accidentally stumbled upon that turned me on to this tech\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen anything about it, definitely check out Spleeter https://github.com/deezer/spleeter\nAt a high level, you give Spleeter a track, and Spleeter uses some trained neural network technology to spit out a bass stem, a drum stem, a vocal stem, and an other stem. If you know what you\u0026rsquo;re doing with it, I believe it can also get you a piano stem, and presumably it can be trained for other things… I digress… I\u0026rsquo;m lazy as heck, and don\u0026rsquo;t mind using somebody else\u0026rsquo;s work. The stems that it kicks out are pretty good, they\u0026rsquo;re not great, and depending on the track your milage may vary. To my ears this sounds like spectral band processing and you hear artifacts that sound like this in the tracks. Honestly though, it is still pretty good.\nNow off to the races. Specifically, the Azuki Max4Live Spleeter https://azuki.bandcamp.com/merch/max-for-live-stem-splitter-spleeter. Azuki put together a video showing off what she did here:\n\u0026amp;feature=emb_logo\nAzuki put together a Docker container that has all of the bits that you need to run this by itself, and a Max4Live device that can work on the selected track. So once you\u0026rsquo;ve got it setup and working it\u0026rsquo;s as easy as loading the plugin, selecting a track, and then telling it to process.\nInstallation is fairly straightforward if you are fairly technical. Azuki\u0026rsquo;s site has a $1 band camp donation link, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need to pay for this. She has a link where you can get it for free (and all this tech is free) at [url]github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max#spleeter-for-max[/url]. So donate if you end up enjoying the work, but it definitely is not necessary.\nWhat you\u0026rsquo;ll need:\nAbleton Live Max4Live Docker Given these parameters, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to be running either a Windows or OS X environment. For me, I got this working on an OS X Catalina deployment. I might try this on Windows later… but we\u0026rsquo;ll see.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that in the instructions it says to give Docker 16GB of memory. For small clips you can probably be able to get away with 2GB, but I found as soon as I started trying to process anything in the 4+ minute timeframe I needed more memory. This is an area where if you want it to work fast more memory and more CPU will probably help.\nMy first attempt at using this technology for real was in the BB 278 https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40\u0026amp;t=197539. For my entry, I took the track and split it up into the drum, bass, vocal, and other sections. That was the only processing that I did on the PC, everything else I did on the MPC including normalizing, chopping, etc. While each track individually had that spectral sound, I\u0026rsquo;d say when you mix the whole track back together it really fades away.\nSplitting the tracks made it very easy to adjust volumes of different parts individually, from filtering, normalization, and I\u0026rsquo;m actually quite happy with the results… especially given that this is free software.\nHere is the track I ended up with\nhttps://soundcloud.com/neartao/bb-278-bahia-destiny\nAnyways… if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for some new tricks to keep up your sleeve definitely check this out. You can probably get it to work without Ableton Live, but what Azuki put together is super slick, especially given that this is free.\nI\u0026rsquo;m probably not going to be able to support people too much who are looking to set this up, but for those curious, definitely reply to the post and I\u0026rsquo;ll do what I can.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/05/19/stems-from-finished-tracks-splitting-tracks-with-spleeter/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI know a lot of folks have been looking for track splitting technology as a holy grail for a while, and figured it\u0026rsquo;d be worth dropping a post.

Instead I figured I\u0026rsquo;d write up why I am going about selling gear off.\nOver the last year I have really been looking to tighten up my process for making music. I also have spent about twenty years collecting gear, and some of that gear has had a habit of collecting dust. It is no particular fault of the gear, but when we work on music we\u0026rsquo;re constantly making choices, and a lot of my choices are of the type \u0026ldquo;this versus that\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;I know how to use this really well and that other device not so much\u0026rdquo;.\nThis has led me to having some level of nostalgia for some of these gear, as I got it at a certain time in my life, or for a specific project, or I just really like it for some reason. However nostalgia alone doesn\u0026rsquo;t really help me make music. While it might inform my tastes of what gear to use, it isn\u0026rsquo;t really helpful as a way for what makes for a more effective process.\nCase in point\u0026hellip; when I was goofing around in #Jamuary\u0026hellip; I mostly used the Pocket Operator KO-33, and while it is definitely not the best sampler\u0026hellip; as something you can have in your pocket for when inspiration strikes. I made more tracks just goofing around with the Knock Out than I had for quite some time before that. Are they finished? Nope, but it really helped get the creative juices flowing.\nBack to the old gear, I\u0026rsquo;ve had a lot of Korg gear, Akai gear, Moog gear, etc\u0026hellip; all just sitting in the closet. Once I got passed the emotional level \u0026ldquo;need\u0026rdquo; to keep it, I\u0026rsquo;ve been having a great time moving the hardware on for a new generation to play with, and it\u0026rsquo;s been helping me fund my next gear I do want to get to. It has really helped me understand the value I have on my gear, and what I can actually get out of it. Sure, some of these boutique pieces of gear would be hard to replace if I wanted it again, but on the other hand they had their day with me.\nAnybody who\u0026rsquo;s out there\u0026hellip; I would really suggest thinking about your gear and how much of it you really need instead of just holding on to \u0026ldquo;just because\u0026rdquo;. For me it has been a great exercise that I will continue. This isn\u0026rsquo;t Pokemon, and there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to \u0026ldquo;catch \u0026rsquo;em all\u0026rdquo;.\nFor me, my new rule is to only keep what I have the time to take care of and maintain.

Given the current state of social distancing and the miles we are away from each other, it has effectively become impossible to see each other in person.\nLike others, a couple of months ago I decided to try setting up some Jackbox games over video conferencing to be able to play some games together. This works by using a video conferencing application that allows you to share your screen or application so that other\u0026rsquo;s can see. What makes Jackbox Games work so well is that everybody has control through their phone, so regardless of location we can all get our phone, tablet, or computer and have a device to control the game.\nInitially we were having audio problems including echos. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest, this was because I was trying to be too fancy. Also, the video application I was using was not playing well with Safari, so I needed to switch over to Google Chrome and use Google Meet for it to share the screen nicely.\nBelow are a few notes that might help get you started:\nI believe Google Meet is now free, so give it a try If Google Meet behaves oddly in your browser of choice, give Google Chrome a try Use Google Calendar (or another shared calendaring system) to schedule game times Get one (or more) versions of Jackbox Games to play\u0026hellip; personally I bought them on steam When you load the Jackbox Games, set your audio volume to about 50%, this will make it easier to talk with others When you are ready to play the game, make sure to share your screen or better, just the application Most importantly, have fun! We have found with a party of 8 players, which is the max for most games, it takes about twenty minutes per game. A little over an hour will get you three games. We\u0026rsquo;ve found that we mix the games up week to week, and sometimes we let the kids choose, sometimes the parents, and sometimes we put it up for a vote.\nThe games that we\u0026rsquo;ve all had the most fun with are the creative games. The games with drawing in them, and Quiplash, have definitely been favorites. The games that have a lot of talking and no written words on the screen have been the hardest to play. Also, we\u0026rsquo;ve just avoided Fibbage because it does require lying and reading the room.\nHave fun everybody, and keep looking for new ways to keep your family together!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/05/15/social-distancing-gaming/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m just writing this for families that, like mine are separated by distance, and are looking for some ways to be able to socially interact together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen getting together with my extended family, we\u0026rsquo;ve always had a blast playing board games and video games together.

Making it all good right?\nTo really get the muddy sound I ran the track through my Chase Bliss Audio pedals, specifically I got a lot of work from Condor for tweaking the EQ\u0026hellip; and this was quite heavy handed since I wasn\u0026rsquo;t worrying about mixing and master the track\u0026hellip; so I was doing some lazy 3 band eq filter mixing\u0026hellip; because that\u0026rsquo;s all you\u0026rsquo;ve got from Condor. If I had tracked everything out through it, one track at a time a 3 eq band can definitely suffice, but yeah\u0026hellip; for a final mix without really any thought to mixing tracks, this is a quick way to get a bit muddy. Again though\u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for this track and it was half of the point.\nThe other muddy buddy in here is the Generation Loss. You can hear that I went pretty noticeable on the wow/flutter, and there\u0026rsquo;s a bit of VHS tape noise simulation in the mix that I filtered down with the LP filter. Ultimately I was going for a sound that really sounded like some of my old tapes that had been used and abused a bit too much, and this is where my memory took me.\nIs it too much? Absolutely! Am I happy with the results? Absolutely!

This way, it maintains a lot of the characteristics of a piano, instead of heading into the field of creating what sounds like a more synthetic instrument.\nFrom here, I routed the audio output into my guitar pedal board. The output on the S950 was a bit hot coming out of the mix channel though, requiring me to get the output level down to about halfway so that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t hearing any clipping or distortion on the output signal from the S950. A little bit of strategic EQ\u0026rsquo;ing helped to round out the sound through Brothers, I wanted to get a bit of that old school Casio sound, though I don\u0026rsquo;t have one handy any more for reference, so I was going from memory what of \u0026ldquo;that sound\u0026rdquo; was.\nOnce I settled into how I wanted to EQ the audio, I routed it to the Generation Loss. You\u0026rsquo;ll definitely hear the Flutter the most, but there is some Wow in the background as well. I also switched on the Noise, I really wanted it to sound like the piano was recorded from an old school tape that had been played quite a bit, and the tape player was about to fall apart. This definitely shines through in the samples recorded.\nEverything was sampled in through the Autosampler on the MPC X, and here I recorded every note, as I didn\u0026rsquo;t want the Wow or Flutter distortion to get further distorted through the sampling engine on the MPC. Although the noise exists in the samples, I decided to tame it a bit by adding a low pass filter into the program. It helps pass through that strained sound without the piano sounding so harsh. If you want to add the noise back in just go into program mode and modify KeyGround-\u0026gt;All and open that filter up.\nAnyway, feel free to play around with this program, I had fun sampling it, and may end up adding some variations as I play around with it. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure you can tune anything to it or with it, but it definitely has a vibe all its own.\ns950-lofi-buttery-piano Download\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/03/08/lofi-buttery-piano-akai-mpc-x-program/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet me start by explaining the patch a bit, and how I got here\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLife started off on the Akai S950, using piano multi samples from G1 through C4, every sixth note\u0026hellip; My goal was to get some of that S950 12-bit grit and artifacts, but still keep it relatively free of the crazy stretching artifacts you can get by just sampling a single note and stretching it across the entire keyboard.

It gives it a nice transition without having obliterating the structure like I have done a few times in past tracks making it sound like several songs.\nA key component here is that I started by chaining 4 patterns together, and then recorded content in real time as the beat played out. With sixteen patterns, this gives you room to record four four bar measures, or two eight bar measures if you so desire. In this case I went with four by four, and it worked well, but didn\u0026rsquo;t leave any room for intros, drops or other glue sounds. As a result, I\u0026rsquo;d say the track is a bit less dynamic, but on the other hand feels a bit more together.\nhttps://youtu.be/eGW5QpjYSDY\nAs usual\u0026hellip; here\u0026rsquo;s the backup of the PO-33 if you want to play around:\nafternoon-breeze-po-33-backup Download\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/01/08/afternoon-breeze-po-33-track/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe image is from my daughter.

Deleting everything is keeping me from being lazy and using previous work to build on. It makes it a bit more effort but certainly keeping me looser when programming the track. I think for my next track though I might record in some new samples and change up the tempo/swing but leave the previous patterns, and automation just to see how it sounds and then tweak it up from there. I suspect with judicious changes you could make a brand new track that might seem inspired by a previous track, but sounds completely different.\nThe track definitely feels like two, or maybe three different ideas jammed into one. The level of consistency is not quite there, but it was fun to put together. I tried a few variations of stringing the patterns together, and settled here. I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten some written down notes of the order of the patterns, and I suspect a few miss presses or missed notes causes some of the oddity here. I\u0026rsquo;m also too lazy to go fix it as it is. There are a few parts of the pattern that I wish had extended or repeated, and a few other parts felt kind of weak. Sure I could have edited the patterns themselves and left the order\u0026hellip; but nah\u0026hellip; this is art.

Seriously folks, I am surprised at how much big sound can come out of such a small device! This is maybe 30 minutes worth of playing around max.\nIf you want a laugh, this is maybe seven, max eight, seconds of audio samples. If I actually put the effort in to trim down the wasted space in the drum track, I might be able to get it down to four or five seconds. Honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m not bothered by it, but it really goes to show even with the old school hardware and multiple limitations, those older machines really could knock out some bangers without too much effort.\nTo get some mileage out of the sounds I recorded you can hear me playing around with the filter and pitch quite a bit. This really helped change the character of some of the verses by making the drums and synth sound different without having to record in whole new parts. I actually spent most of my time crafting variants of the various patterns leveraging the FX to create some great variety with minimum time investment. A few parts I\u0026rsquo;d chain a couple bars together so that I could hear what it sounded like back to back creating fills over two bars. I\u0026rsquo;ll likely do this again in the future and is a good way to get out of the problem of working in a single bar.\nOf course, some issues came up while producing this track. Volume balance for the synth sound became obvious only once I had recorded the vocal section. No matter how much I boosted the volume of the vocals, applied filters to the vocals, etc\u0026hellip; it just wouldn\u0026rsquo;t cut through. Being lazy by nature, instead of re-recording the vocals I decided to just apply some filtering and volume to the synth, but once you\u0026rsquo;ve laid down sounds in the PO-33 you\u0026rsquo;re going to need to hold down the write button while you turn the knobs to get it applied. I only had two patterns at the time, so it was not a big deal.

It definitely has a special place in my life.\nI have been seriously considering picking up a Korg Triton Rack, but it is pricey, you don\u0026rsquo;t know what problems you are inheriting, and it most of the eBay/Reverb postings have none of the upgrades. So you\u0026rsquo;re left with a perfectly fine, but stock device, and the upgrade boards are quite expensive.\nI had purchased the Korg Legacy collection years ago, and was incredibly underwhelmed, the mini MS-20 hardware that came along with it was adorable, but ultimately it just didn\u0026rsquo;t wow me, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother upgrading.

She\u0026rsquo;s doing well now, but it was pretty touch and go for a couple of weeks. The worst thing was that she just was not interested in eating, and she lost a lot of weight.\nAs other pet owners know, the doggie cone of shame sucks. Fortunately we didn\u0026rsquo;t have to use it this time, but we did need to get her the inflatable neck brace to keep her from losing stitches. I was concerned she was going to hate it, but apparently having a portable pillow around your neck at all times is nice because she found the strangest places to get comfortable and go to sleep.\nWhat happened? She was throwing up excessively for two and a half days, to the point I knew that is wasn\u0026rsquo;t some kind of flu, but something was seriously wrong. I took the poor girl to our local vet, and she did some MRI scans, but besides seeing a weird ring, there wasn\u0026rsquo;t anything obvious that they could see as a blockage. The local vet told me to take her as soon as possible to another vet to get ultrasounds done. Fortunately she was still drinking water, and able to keep that down, so for me, while this was a severe problem, it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel dire yet.\nI scheduled the ultrasounds for the next day, and got her down. All they could see was a mass, which usually means a tumor in these cases. The vet was super emotional as he told me this, and asked if it was okay to do an aspiration. I figured it was worth doing it to see if there was anything obvious that could be done, but she is really young to be having a tumor at this point. So the vet took her to do the aspiration, and when he came back he said he had good news, but also bad news. The growth was not a tumor, but it was instead fecal matter. He then explained that the ring they saw from the MRI was possibly an inverted intestine, ad I would need to go to a 24x7 vet clinic to get the surgery done. He suggested I take her immediately, but she was still very energetic and I asked if it was okay to have them check one more time the next day.\nFor those of you that don\u0026rsquo;t know, and inverted intestine is when the lining rolls in on itself, effectively creating a pouch. The problem with this, is especially when there is a mass involved, it will keep pushing that pouch into a larger mass, effectively blocking your whole intestine. Which, would explain the vomiting, because the poor girl couldn\u0026rsquo;t pass anything through her digestive system.\nThe next day I did bring her down, and with some luck, the vet was able to determine from another ultrasound that she did not have an inverted intestine, and he believed that he could do the surgery at his office. This sounded good, because the 24x7 veterinary office was likely to be three to four times more expensive.\nThe surgery went well, but we learned that the blockage was some kind of absorbent material and strangely, fecal matter. The vet kept asking me if she had been around babies or diapers lately, because it was all stuck in her small intestines. Apparently they had to remove about eight to fifteen inches of her small intestines, because whatever the material was, it had torn her insides up pretty badly, to the point she was about to, if she had not already, gone septic.\nI was able to pick her up from surgery the next day, and she really was out of it from all the medication. She heard my voice, and did half a tail wag. The next few days she ate nearly nothing, and I was having to force feed her medication just to help her get probiotics, antibiotics, and pain medication down.\nOn the fourth day post surgery, we were desperate to get her to eat anything. We found that she was interested in eating baby food. My daughter got her to eat two small containers of baby food. We were all pretty excited that she was finally eating. Unfortunately in the evening while she was sleeping, the poor dog had explosive diarrhea. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into describing it, but suffice it to say, we definitely fed her too much, and it was a pretty traumatic experience.\nIt took a few more days for her appetite to really come back, and start putting her weight back on. She\u0026rsquo;s back to eating solid food, her stomach is all healed up from the surgery, and she\u0026rsquo;s running and jumping again. She\u0026rsquo;s not pushing herself like she used to, and she hasn\u0026rsquo;t been going out to grab her balls for us to toss, but I\u0026rsquo;m just happy that she\u0026rsquo;s healthy.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2019/12/31/life-sometimes/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOne of my dogs got super sick, and needed a trip to the emergency room.

Some jazzy chords, played a bit out of time, but routed through the Chase Bliss Mood with the slip filter running, which makes it pretty hard to make things sound like they are played in time. This formed the basis of why you\u0026rsquo;ll see some of the chords sound like they are the tail, and other parts come in much louder. I then routed this through the Chase Bliss Generation Loss, which you\u0026rsquo;d think was drizzling the noise into this sample, but no, I can thank my USB charger for my computer for this. I figured I was going to add noise anyways, so why not leave it in. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I have a ground loop problem or something else, but it\u0026rsquo;s quite noisy, and I know it\u0026rsquo;s from my external USB C graphics, because when it is running off the battery it is fine. So all of that it is run through the Generation Loss high pass and low pass filter, then dumped into the Gen to bit crush quite a bit, and with some added flutter.\nAnyways, Sloppy Piano is the result, if you want to take your hand at chopping it go nuts, it\u0026rsquo;s got some interesting sounds here, but as I said, due to poor playing, and the Mood slip, you\u0026rsquo;re not really going to get any straight chops.

Q2 on my MPC was super sketchy. Loading up the JJOS v3 test menu showed Q2 was going from a range of about 300-500, and normal operation is 0-1000. Another fun problem was that moving Q1 was also making a subtle change to Q2. That\u0026rsquo;s definitely not supposed to happen!\nI figured there were a few things to try in order to resolve this.\nIt might just be that the Q-Link board was horribly damaged, and needed to be replaced. A quick look on www.mpcstuff.com showed that this was going to cost a bit in order to go this route. The fader could be gunked up with dust, and just need to be blown out. The older gear gets, the more dust it picks up, and a lot of pots, faders, and tact switches might need to be sprayed with DeOxit, blown out with air, or otherwise freed of gunk. The cable that connects to the Q-Link board might have gotten oxidized, and in desperate need of being reseated. I figured I\u0026rsquo;d start with the low cost solutions. It\u0026rsquo;s honestly not that hard to pop the MPC 1k open, so I figured I\u0026rsquo;d just get a closer look. My strategy was to disconnect the cables to the board in case of a bad connection, and blow the fader out with some compressed air. While I can say that using your breath can help this suffers from two problems\u0026hellip; first is that if you\u0026rsquo;re allergic to dust you may get a face full which isn\u0026rsquo;t so great, and second the moisture in your breath can do long term damage to electronics. The moisture might seem like a \u0026ldquo;so what\u0026rdquo;, but the older your gear is, the less time you want to spend repairing it.\nBefore putting the case back together, I figured I\u0026rsquo;d give it the good old JJOS test.

In particular I added some Wow to give the sound a bit of somewhat repetitive but also unstable character, and added some mild noise in order to dirty up the noise a bit while also running it through the low pass just to clean it up a hair.\nOnce I was happy enough with the sound, I setup a basic eight note pattern on the OP-1 with Endless, matched the BPM to the MPC 1k, and recorded off the passage.

I tried to check it out the next day, but it was already sold out. I spent the next few days wondering if I really needed this device, or it was going to be an effect I should just pass on. I checked out the Knobs video as well as Andy Othling\u0026rsquo;s video and I have to say, they both intrigued me. So I setup a feed on Reverb to keep me apprised of whenever Generation Loss might start showing up on the scalper market on Reverb and eBay.\nWhen I got back home and to reality, and had a bit of jet lag, I happened to see Generation Loss start showing up, and yeah\u0026hellip; I decided to bite the bullet and order one, for a reasonable (I\u0026rsquo;ll just have to keep telling myself this) cost of something that was marked up pretty high. I\u0026rsquo;m now seeing it pop up in my Reverb feed for $700 and higher, and while I fortunately didn\u0026rsquo;t spend that much, it was still pretty pricey.\nBefore dropping into impressions, a perfectly fair question would be, why buy it at all? I\u0026rsquo;ve already got effects that can do similar things as Generation Loss, such as the Eurorack Magneto, the OTO Biscuit, and plenty of software that mimics these old tape effects and digital distortion effects. To be brutally honest why I was interested in it, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, other than I really like the Chase Bliss Mood, and I\u0026rsquo;ve really started to dig the company. I am not a guitarist, but their pedals seem very well made, packed with interesting features, and I really feel like I jive with the company philosophy that they at least project in their marketing.\nI really dig the old school sounds, and I\u0026rsquo;m a sucker for effects that both degrade sound quality while also imparting some new character to the audio. This totally pegs me as a sucker for lo-fi samplers, tape effects, bit reducers, FM radio, etc, and absolutely explains a large amount of my music gear.\nTo kick off initial impressions, I absolutely cannot suggest to anybody to pick up this pedal, no matter how amazing it is, for the prices it is going for in the over $600 range. If you\u0026rsquo;ve got cash burning a hole in your pocket, I mean go for it, but for the price scalpers are demanding, I\u0026rsquo;m going to kick myself and just tell you to pass for now. I hope that Chase Bliss sees the demand for this device and comes out with a non limited run version. Hopefully they are shocked in a good way at the demand, but the economics of this just don\u0026rsquo;t look that great. 1000 sold in less than a day is really amazing, but it is just sad to see the sale prices on Reverb. Hopefully it goes down in cost, and it\u0026rsquo;s entirely possible that the market value will correct as we continue to see more people dumping this pedal. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping a lot of these pedals found happy homes, but I can also see this as an effect that a lot of people might not be in love with.\nAll that said, so far I am really into this pedal. The controls are really hands on, and as with other Chase Bliss pedals are pretty tightly packed with features. Having a separate Wow and Flutter control is, hands down, a great feature that is not always seen in effects. The Generation control sounds pretty good for a bit of lo-fi digital bit crushing, and the Hiss switch lets you chose if you want no hiss, mild hiss with a little flutter, or heavy hiss with a lot of flutter. If these were the only things available to control I\u0026rsquo;d be happy, and I was definitely less interested in the High Pass or Low Pass filter. From the sound of it, the High Pass filter doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound to me like it adds any character, but the Low Pass filter does sound like it has some resonance and possibly another effect that helps the sound shine a bit further. The Wet knob is actually super handy, as it allows you to substantially drive the wet signal and can help keep the sound boosted in a mix where it might otherwise settle into the back due to all the flutter, wow, and (de)generation of your sound.\nFor the afternoon I\u0026rsquo;ve been throwing a bevy of piano, synths, bass, and drums at Generation Loss, and don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I\u0026rsquo;ll be recording some more patches to load up here in no time and get some A/B comparisons put together to show off what I think is special about this pedal.\nFor the piano and synth sounds I pushed through Generation Loss, I\u0026rsquo;ve got to say, all the knobs were worthing tweaking, and really gave some great results. In particular, dialing in the Low Pass and High Pass filters was great over a one or two octave range. Where I feel it feel down a bit was trying to make a full patch sound. This is something that in a traditional synth/sampler, you\u0026rsquo;d probably have the filter(s) follow the keyboard, but obviously as a pedal this isn\u0026rsquo;t something so easy to do. I can see how you can probably do one of LP or HP filter with the EXP/CV input, but I suspect for more advanced programming you\u0026rsquo;ll really want to dust off the MIDI manual and use the MIDI/AUX port. I\u0026rsquo;ve got plenty of time to get into MIDI, but this does look pretty full featured and ought to be able to control both the LP and HP parameters separately.\nThe bass sounds responded really well to the Wow and Flutter, but I felt like the LP filter also imparted some fantastic character. It is subtle, but sounds really good, Chase Bliss pedals often say \u0026ldquo;Digital brain Analogue Heart\u0026rdquo;, and the LP filter definitely sounds like it has a bit more of the analogue roundness that I enjoy. On the other hand, the bass that I was playing around with did not respond terribly well to the Gen knob. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad, but it went from a not very obvious effect to completely degraded quickly. Lower frequencies don\u0026rsquo;t need as many bits/frequency to reproduce (see Nyquist theory), so I suspect it is just harder to notice right away for bass sounds.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll end with my impression on drums for the day. Here Gen was great, and really imparted some quick character to the drums, and instead I\u0026rsquo;d have to say Wow and Flutter just didn\u0026rsquo;t show through. This is to be expected for sounds that have a quick attack and quick decay such as a drum. I am positive that the Wow and Flutter were impacting the drums, but because they weren\u0026rsquo;t ringing out for any length of time it is just harder to hear unless you are really paying attention. Sure, there is probably some psychological character but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how much it is worth spending the time for drums here. Of note though, the Hiss switch really did add a good amount of dirt to the drums in a way that was more obvious. If you like filter sweeps on your drums, I\u0026rsquo;d also say that the LP/HP filter sections on Generation Loss is quite good and will give you the usual results.\nTo me, this is a good device, and I can see it staying in my collection. That said, I\u0026rsquo;ll repeat that the astronomical cost probably puts it out of the reach of most sane people at this time. However, if you\u0026rsquo;re crazy like me, then I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure you\u0026rsquo;ll enjoy this device. I will be taking some time to get videos together showing off the device, so stay tune!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2019/11/05/chase-bliss-generation-loss-first-impressions/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhile I was traveling to Bangalore for work Chase Bliss dropped the Generation Loss, and unfortunately I missed the pre-order window on Reverb.

Honestly, I could have probably squeezed it in a bit better, but I was trying to let some of the longer notes ring out.\nI played the samples pitched down a bit in the S950 to get a bit more grit and deepen the kick drum and bass notes. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty happy with the patch as it is, though you\u0026rsquo;ll notice that the bongo sounding hit has a lot of noise in it. I had normalized all the notes together, but you could still barely notice the bongo, particularly in a mix. I ended up normalizing the bongo, but this also amplified the line noise. It could probably use some filtering, but for anybody who likes having dirtier samples, that bongo is for you.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve gone through and color coded the pads just for my visual preference so I can get a sense for what different sounds are on different pads. You\u0026rsquo;ll find the bottom row is drums, the two middle rows are bass, which I converted to note on instead of one shots, and I set all of the bass notes on a mute group so that you don\u0026rsquo;t drown out the bass.
