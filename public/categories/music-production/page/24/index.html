Well this one was a bit more of a pain to get started. I have had a mild headache most of the day and just didn‚Äôt want to put any energy into making a track‚Ä¶ however the show must go on!
The picture is courtesy of my basement‚Ä¶ and the dead spider is courtesy of the glass apparently trapping it in. I don‚Äôt exactly know what made me think of the picture or the title for the track, but somehow they are now linked in my brain waves.

The picture comes courtesy of a trip to Munich. Not so much a tourist type of city, but there‚Äôs a lot to see there. I think that particular shot came from a train ride that I took with my family to go check out the Olympic Stadium out there. It was interesting to see, but kind of sad at the same time to see something that had so much funding and investment put into it that ended up not being kept up and maintained as much as you‚Äôd hope. I suspect that a lot of the Olympic areas around the world are like this, and I suppose when things get back to normal I will have to travel around to check out more for myself.

The picture is from my trip to Athens Greece with some filters on it. Nothing fancy, but the statue was incredible to see in person.

    <p>Day twenty‚Ä¶ I can feel that the end of jamcember is nearing :D
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/tea-in-the-dark
Today I went back to the now ‚Äúold‚Äù standard of making some loops in Reason Studio, working on some sound design to get some interesting sounds, and then bouncing the loops out to be chopped.
A few things I tried to switch it up. First, I made four bar loops, but extended them out to eight bars, because I wanted the ambience to flow through to the start of the first bar, instead of hearing the loop in the first bar kind of catch up. Something sounds a bit off‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs possible that I have an LFO that is not sync‚Äôd to the track, or maybe my copy/paste of notes was bad. I tried it‚Ä¶ and while it didn‚Äôt work quite how I wanted, well‚Ä¶ it still produced results.

I just like this track‚Ä¶ guess I have nothing else to say about it today :D
Update:
Okay‚Ä¶ I was being lazy yesterday‚Ä¶ cleaning up after the blizzard kind of got to me.
For this track I really decided to pair down the frantic energy and focus a bit more on natural sounding instruments with some air, space, and environment to them. As I said yesterday, I am quite happy about how it came out, though mixing was a bit of a pain due to how different the levels were on all of the tracks.

As for the track, probably approaching the last days during this month of pulling content off of Reason Studio daily and then chopping up loops for inspiration, so I‚Äôll be looking around for another sound source or two for the month just to push myself in other directions. I‚Äôve been itching to do some sound recording, and who knows, maybe I go industrial?

I am still having a blast making loops in Reason and exporting it out to the MPC for chopping up. This track had a lot going on with it, and I had fun making the initial four bars‚Ä¶ but once I got started tracking it out into a song things really went sideways. The transitions just didn‚Äôt work and the track started to fall apart. I think it was more a case of a few different sounds just not supporting each other very well and while I was having fun making the four bar loop it wasn‚Äôt obvious, but when trying to put transitions together it became a bit jarring.

This track needed some mixing love, I tried to nail it, but I still think the saw synth is a bit intense. Perhaps this is what the track needed? I‚Äôm not sure. After this many tracks can I really be sure of anything?
Well, I am sure that all of the content was yet again produced in Reason Studio, and I ran it through the Yorgos Arabatzsis Mastering. I‚Äôm getting a bit more of a handle with both making loops in Reason Studio 11, and working with YAM to get the sounds I am looking for, and pushing the sounds I don‚Äôt like back.
