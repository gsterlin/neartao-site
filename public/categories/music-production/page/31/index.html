    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So a few days back I posted about picking up an Akai MPC 500 on Reverb‚Ä¶ and it was absolutely a mess inside. In case you didn‚Äôt see it, I‚Äôll post a picture below, but it was all jacked up. I suspect something heavy was dropped on it, or some other excessive amount of force. Maybe you can help decide?
So yeah, it was busted enough to snap the PCB in several places, and you can see where the metal frame got bent as well. Yesterday I picked up some Krazy Glue in preparation for the attempt for a big fix. I figured that particular glue would likely be the best way to hope to put the PCB back together as it does a really solid job bonding plastics. On the negative side, I am always getting this stuff stuck to my fingers and all over the place‚Ä¶ so I wasn‚Äôt exact thrilled to be working with it again.

    <p>https://soundcloud.com/neartao/stbb-695-running-forever
This track comes courtesy of STBB Forever BB #695, there were two tracks to chop up. The rules were effectively to chop whatever, use your own drums, no external instruments, and you needed to drop a change up in the track. I‚Äôm interested to see what others do this week.
Similar to the MPC BB this week, I was really crunched for time to work on this. This time however I decided I would just do the track in the PO-33, and make it a quick flip. So I loaded the tracks into the MPC, but didn‚Äôt even bother chopping on the MPC, I just shuffled the starting point around the tracks and sampled in what ever I wanted to start or stop, and was able to get four or five interesting chops pretty quickly from the first track. For the second track, I just sampled roughly a loop, and let the auto chopper do it‚Äôs magic, or horrible destruction.

This picture comes courtesy of Photoshop Camera on the iPhone with one of the goofy filters.

I came from Ableton myself‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs a much different environment.
The main things to get your head wrapped around on the MPC is sampling and sample management, programs (drums and key groups mostly), tracks and how to drop notes across various tracks to group things, and sequences to hold each section of your song.

    <p>New Beat Battle up at STBB Forever #694. Was a fun one, and I pulled content from the four tracks. A lot of cool things to sample, and the rules were effectively no hats, and record your own percussion.
I pulled a lot of fun glass bell, horns, strings, piano, etc‚Ä¶ all sounded really good. I just focussed on straight up one shot type sounds, and maybe a few hits with a bit of extra sound on them. I was able to put together quite a few tracks and sequences on the MPC, but honestly a lot of them just didn‚Äôt work together well, so I grabbed the sections I thought worked well enough and strung them together as best I could. So yeah, not exactly proud of this track, but I am trying to keep putting tracks together and retraining my ear for these things.

Besides, trap is what dark vibes, ratchets, whoa/yeah/what shoutouts, and is pretty diverse BPM wise. I guess I forgot the shoutouts on my track though, so at least one mistake. Or was it? No, I forgot to put in some murmurs, shout outs, etc‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going back to update the track.

    <p>My sister has released the book SOMNIUM Beyond the Darkness on Amazon as a kindle book and as a paperback book, which is an excellent read for young adults and adults alike. She‚Äôs been looking to expand out into the audio book space, which makes sense to me!
She had been looking into some voice actors who could read the book. When I heard the audio quality of the demo, it was rather poor. We were hoping that it was just a quick demo, but it suffered from a lot of background noise. My sister passed on links to the voice actor, and the demo‚Äôs she had on her website were great. After I gave my sister a few questions to ask and suggestions for contract negotiations, unfortunately it fell through. We suspect that the voice actor recorded her website demo at a professional studio, and likely recorded the demo she produced for my sister at home. Total bummer, but it‚Äôs better to both live and learn, and get through these miss steps early is what I always say.

    <p>Well I rushed my MPC Forums beat battle submission, and ended up deciding to post a track to STBB Forever this time. Not sure that I‚Äôll dive deep into the STBB community and beat battles or not, but it‚Äôs fun to find some other communities and see what may or may not stick with you.
For the STBB #693 track, there was a *lot* of content to parse through, and there was a lot that would absolutely trip up on a submission to YouTube or Soundcloud. So, who knows how long my submission will last, but it is posted for now. The rules were pretty simple, use something from every track, no snares on 2 or 4, and something about being able to used instruments, but no sampled melodic content. I decided to just use all of the content just from the tracks, that‚Äôs been most of my style lately, and it makes it more of a fun challenge to see what you can squeeze out.
