      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most importantly (for me at least) is I&amp;rsquo;m still kicking! For those who have been paying attention, I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly branching out into other instruments on my YouTube channel, and starting to look into things like the Dirtywave M8, Roland P-6, and Ableton Move. There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of cool gear out there, and certainly not enough free time to cover it all. That said, I do try and keep the Guide going as new thoughts come to mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming to get the guide updated for firmware 4.04, but it is finally here! What&amp;rsquo;s happened in between? Well I dropped the Quick Reference for the SP404 mk2, which was a lot of fun to make, but super time consuming. Plus within just a few days of releasing it, Roland dropped the 4.04 firmware update. I decided to invest the effort into updating the Quick Reference for 4.04 rather than the guide, and then I sunk time into getting some 4.04 videos out. It&amp;rsquo;s been a crazy couple of months!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an updated version of the guide. At this point, it is mostly changes coming in from people asking questions on my YouTube videos, and my curiosity to dig in and see if I can find suitable answers, solutions, or in some cases workflows. So the update is again an accumulation of a lot of minor tweaks and things I have learned about the SP404 mk2 from people asking questions that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the answer to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Roland SP-404 mk2 Guide v0.28</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2023/07/15/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-28/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Jul 2023 15:03:54 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3940</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a few simple tweaks for today based on some information I learned while running a few experiments (and answering questions) on my live stream at &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtube.com/live/LT8YEWt7zuY?feature=share&#34;&gt;https://youtube.com/live/LT8YEWt7zuY?feature=share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was to figure out a few volume maximums/limits, especially for recording. I decided to use the USB-C audio interface connection from the SP404 mk2 to my computer since it is a digital connection and I assume (a bit grossly perhaps) that it should be consistent for us. From here, I spent some time recording test tones, tried to record as loud as I could through the line ins and mic/inst jack without clipping, and then did some comparative analysis through Ableton Live to see how these various recordings compared to normalized audio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a first pass to try and incorporate all of the changes that came in for Firmware 3.0. I am quite certain I&amp;rsquo;ve got to go back and rewrite sections, organize some data differently, and overall rethink how this guide is put together. That said, I did spend a lot of time trying to get everything together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.27.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.27&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.27.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3864</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m behind on getting updates to 3.0. This still covers firmware 2.01, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be pivoting to 3.0 soon, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.26.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.26&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.26.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just excited to see 3.0 drop, and this update was really just to get me back in the habit of writing updates, in prep for whenever something big happened. Last week I tried doing some live streams to chat with folks while also working on the guide, some of them worked, and some of them didn&amp;rsquo;t. If you catch a stream, feel free to drop in and say hi, ask questions, give suggestions, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3840</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; a lot has happened over the last four(?!) months, for me personally&amp;hellip; not so much the mk2 guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.25.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.25&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.25.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see, where to start? I got my first donation of $5 over at buymeacoffee.com, super cool, and big thanks. I know I keep telling you all it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary (it isn&amp;rsquo;t), and I keep doing all of this work for free, but I also want to say it is greatly appreciated. It&amp;rsquo;s going into my future gear purchase fund when I find the next device I want to dig into. I suspect I know what it will be, but well, let&amp;rsquo;s wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey folks, guess it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly three months since I last updated the guide. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.24.pdf&#34;&gt;NearTao&amp;rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.24&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.24.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first pass at trying to get the firmware 2.0 changes wrapped around my head. I know I missed a few section updates, mostly in the settings area, and I am sure there are some shortcuts I need to wrap around to getting added into the guide, but by and large I do feel like I understand it pretty well now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>303 Vinyl Sim Noise</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2022/05/15/303-vinyl-sim-noise/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 22:06:06 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3789</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A request over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/SP404/comments/uqbfvj/sp_303_vinyl_sim_req/&#34;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; came in for some Vinyl Sim Noise recorded off of a 303. Why? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; but maybe the user will provide some details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To record this, I just hooked the 303 up to the 404 mk2, turned on the Vinyl Sim on the 303, turned off Compression and Wow, and did a few passes at Volume and Noise levels. After that, did the old record, and then exported to SD. Nothing fancy here&amp;hellip; and with nothing else playing, at high levels it&amp;rsquo;s pretty noisy. Didn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be clipping on the mk2, so I think these should all be pretty clean&amp;hellip; well as clean as it&amp;rsquo;s going to get.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3773</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A request came in to add a shortcut section, so I added an Appendix G and tried to organize it in a way that made more sense to me than what information is in the official manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.23.pdf&#34;&gt;NearTao&amp;rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.23&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.23.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anybody has been wondering where the updates have been for the guide, well I&amp;rsquo;ve partly been lazy, I have been trying to figure out how to improve the YouTube videos for the mk2, and well I went on vacation. The vacation was with my family, we drove about 1200 or so miles to get down to North Carolina, and I had a lot of fun at both the Ocean Isles Beach, and then we spent a day in South Carolina at Myrtle Beach. I did bring the mk2 with me, and was able to spend the first day with my nephew showing him a bit about the mk2, but he is more interested in his iPad and using Garage Band at this time. We had fun, but beyond that I hardly touched the mk2. Not for lack of trying, but it was a lot of driving, keeping friends and family entertained, cooking, and at the end of the day just being tired. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping I&amp;rsquo;ll get some more time in July with the mk2 on my trip to Brazil with my family&amp;hellip; *fingers crossed*.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1313/2022/04/11/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-22/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:02:24 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3763</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The update is mostly focussed on the Midi and Companion App chapters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.22.pdf&#34;&gt;NearTao&amp;rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.22.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the &amp;ldquo;big news&amp;rdquo; is that firmware version 1.15 dropped. It fixes a couple of bugs, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever hit them. Given this rather weak update for the mk2, my suspicion is that we&amp;rsquo;re not likely to see anything terribly interesting for firmware updates until the supply chain issues work themselves out. I get it, Roland wants to get the most market bang for the buck, and if they are continuing to sell through stock before it ever hits the shelves, then there is no reason to do anything expansive until they need to be able to drive more business. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to be proven wrong, but I just don&amp;rsquo;t think belly aching about the lack of new filters, or new features, or whatever you&amp;rsquo;d like is going to get much traction right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Roland SP-404 mk2 Guide v0.21</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2022/03/29/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-21/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 17:41:05 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3760</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The update is mostly focussed on system settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.21.pdf&#34;&gt;NearTao&amp;rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.21.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big section update is for the Chapter on the Utility menu, and for at least System, Pad Set, and EFX Set, I have added as much color and detail as possible without loosing my mind. I know I&amp;rsquo;ve said I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t try to recreate the manual, but I felt it was important to go over these sections because the interface does a poor job explaining what some of the settings are, and the manual isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly clear of why you would want to use some of these settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1313/2022/03/21/roland-sp-404-mk2-guide-v0-20/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 21:39:39 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3750</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is mostly about restructuring the guide&amp;hellip; and setting it up for a more consumable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.20.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.20&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.20.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to take so long, or be such a small update overall, but I guess I fell off the working on the mk2 wagon. Part of my time went to wrapping up artwork for a children&amp;rsquo;s book I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on with my sister for a year now, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know… I guess I just haven&amp;rsquo;t felt myself much the last two or three weeks. No big deal, but just kind of hit this funk. The &amp;ldquo;I am tired of being home all the time and never really seeing anybody&amp;rdquo; head space. Ended up taking a long weekend with my wife in Burlington VT while my parent&amp;rsquo;s watched our daughter and two dogs. Was good to get out, have a few beers, and if anything, it did give me a bit of a reset and clear my head some.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DJ Mode and the related topics are more or less done now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.19.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.19.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My daughter has school vacation this week and I decided to take the time off to both spend with her and get some more time into working on the guide. This update was actually really good in that it got me more thinking about how to write up DJ Mode over the last few days, as well as really thinking about what I think is actually valuable for the guide in general.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well, between continuing writing up the guide, and making videos, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s out there and seems to be helping people out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting a bit of folks posting here or there. If you&amp;rsquo;ve written me a message someplace and I haven&amp;rsquo;t responded I promise I am not ignoring you, I&amp;rsquo;m just ignoring the forums so I can make sure I have time to write and record as my primary focus. I am trying to get around to catching up on the various forums once a week or so. Thanks to those of you have reached out though, it means a lot and I am glad I could help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3719</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boy, another big update. I was planning on moving to a weekly schedule for updates to be more consistent, but these bigger updates also feel more draining. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.17-2.pdf&#34;&gt;NearTao&amp;rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.17&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.17-2.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this update is just writing up the effects section, and I tried to stick to give my thoughts and advice for the effects, rather than just rehashing whatever is in the manual. As with a lot of the guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually come back and rewrite sections, or add some more content, but as it stands, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write any more about bread and butter effects that you can find anywhere. Although it is alphabetical, you&amp;rsquo;ll certainly find where I started to loose my mind trying to write up something about some of the effects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, an absolutely epic update today. This one broke my brain working on it for about five hours straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.16.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.16.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a fair amount of time just getting the handful of pages written up about Skip Back. I had to chase down a few things that I thought I knew how they worked, but I wanted to make sure I captured it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real work though, was filling out the previously titled Mixer section, and now renamed to Audio Signal Flow section. Just drawing the diagram was a lot of work, and then peeling apart each layer was an important onion to break down, but holy smokes. I kind of just gave up at the Limiter and Clipper section because I don&amp;rsquo;t see *anything* that remotely explains how they work for the mk2 or why they are there. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen some people mentioning the mk2 coloring their sound, and I wonder if there is something going on here&amp;hellip; which will require some experiments, but I am D O N E for the day. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get more time on the book tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Roland SP-404 mk2 Guide v0.15</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3705</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This update focus on the Sample Mode section, and I dumped in some of the related topics like Chromatic, Cue, and other things that can help determine how a pad may play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.15.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.15&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.15.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, I spent probably way too much time to figure out how End Mark works, but I figured it out and documented it. This helped land a few updates into the Sample Edit section to also add information about copy/delete for a sample. I kind of think I already typed this up in data management, but whatever&amp;hellip; if I duplicated information, well I can get around to fixing it when I get to a place where I am ready to start reviewing the document. For now, I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to get it as complete as I can.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3699</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spent some time on the Sample Edit section, and tried to think about how to discuss some workflows without getting into it too deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.14.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.14&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.14.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to strike the right balance between opinions, thoughts on how to do things, and just stuff that feels like issues with Sample Edit. Maybe I am being too picky, or maybe these things could just work better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still happy with the mk2 though, and will continue writing things up. I&amp;rsquo;ve just started a new job, so trying to balance transitioning my old work, picking up new work, family, and working on music, has caused me to slow down a bit on the guide for a little bit. I promise I am still keeping at it though!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of this update was filling in the Sample section to the best of my abilities within my time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.13.pdf&#34;&gt;NearTao&amp;rsquo;s SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.13&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.13.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some things that I thought I understood about sampling on the mk2, that I&amp;rsquo;m clearly going to have to go back to. I also skipped on the Skip Back section, because honestly, I think it deserves it&amp;rsquo;s own heading/section as it is quite distinct (though related) to sampling, and has some interesting workflow implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This update was to try and fill in some information about the actual Data in the mk2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.12.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.12&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.12.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time trying to figure out the directory structure and format of different files. So far I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out much about the .bin files, or how the mk2 might be storing or managing much of the data. This will take some time to work through, and I have a few ideas for experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another experiment, and trying to wrap up the Audio Input/Audio Export sections&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.11.pdf&#34;&gt;neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.11.pdf&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got some ideas for linking some working session videos with the guide, so stay tuned for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two days were mostly about trying to flesh out some of the existing sections some more. Primarily the audio input section, but that also drove me to adding a new section for audio output as well. I&amp;rsquo;m nearly done with these, and should be able to get into more detail for getting into sampling and adjusting samples soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still having fun with the mk2! I find it to occupy a nice space between my other gear, it&amp;rsquo;s not as powerful as the MPC Live as a sampler or for creating patterns, but there&amp;rsquo;s also something refreshing about being limited. Also, the product line has been quite focussed on resampling in the past, and the 404 mk2 really isn&amp;rsquo;t different from that regard. To get the most out of it you&amp;rsquo;re encouraged to sample from your line/instrument/mic inputs and use fx to sculpt a sound from there. Yeah yeah&amp;hellip; super natural for people who have been there, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing some people saying they are not into resampling&amp;hellip; and what the SP to be something it probably never will be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was bummed to hear that CooperFX was going to end making guitar pedals, but super excited to learn that the next move is to begin working on pedals with Chase Bliss Audio. Amazing! Even more amazing, is that the Satellite card was released as the last card for the Cooper FX: Arcades. Definitely excited to hear what is in store for CooperFX in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/4vrRePz-gBY&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/4vrRePz-gBY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is the last hurrah for the Arcades. My advice to others, unless you have a reason to have the Satellite card for the XP-300 space station emulation, I&amp;rsquo;d hold out and see what this morphs into over in Chase Bliss land.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More or less took a couple week musical break. Two things happened. First, I wanted to do some more case modifications to my make noise case… and having to take it apart, drill and Dremel… it was a several day investment of time for getting it all squared away, measure everything to get it to fit, get it back together… and just hope that I haven&amp;rsquo;t overloaded the power supply!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These notes are all for SP 404 mk2 firmware 1.13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In pattern mode there is a slight gap between the end of a pattern and the start back to 1.1.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In pattern mode edit, you cannot adjust the start position of the pattern, only the end position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exported samples do not contain the project they were from, just named “&amp;lt;bank 1-10&amp;gt; &lt;pad&gt; &lt;sample name&gt; Sample”.  The bank should be a-j to match naming, it should include the project, and there ought to be a way to name the sample.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exporting samples will overwrite whatever you have on the SD card without warning you that there is already a sample there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3582</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had some slight misinformation… the semitone changes with PITCH/SPEED are -12 semitones and +7 semitones for a range (effectively down 50% or up 50%). The CHROMATIC mode can do +/- 12 semitones. Obviously you can resample to stretch beyond this… but wanted to clarify that if you&amp;rsquo;ve got something specific you&amp;rsquo;re looking to do that you may want to make sure you know what mode(s) can do what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I messed around for a couple hours today and was able to get a few samples going, dug into resampling and skip back… and you can def make some solid loops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Roland SP-404 mk2 is in... Initial Thoughts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got mine Wednesday&amp;hellip; been knocking on the pads quite a bit. Never had a 404 (but got the 202 and 303)&amp;hellip; mostly a heavy MPC user&amp;hellip; so my thoughts come at this through mostly an MPC lens, but definitely with appreciation of where the SP line has come from in previous generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I did was hook up my iPad to the mk2 over USB C. I will tell you, this is an amazingly seamless connection that carries audio and midi data like a champ. Some apps you may have to worry about routing, but stuff like Koala Sampler and Korg Module Pro work wonderfully. You can throw audio and samples around so damn fast it&amp;rsquo;ll make your head spin, and is just *chef&amp;rsquo;s kiss* for bouncing effects back and forth. Even better, if you have Audio Bus 3 or AUM, you can access the stereo inputs, or two stereo outputs directly. Heck, you can even route to outputs 1/2/3/4 as mono, and get your iPad four mono track outputs as it honors those outputs correctly. All of this works without going into any special modes, or booting the 404 as a controller or anything else. Seriously a killer feature in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure why, but this feels like it is in the space of the &amp;lsquo;peak sound&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve been working towards with this setup. Still a bit noisy and still a bit awkward to control sometimes, but hands on, a bit glitchy, and something that can sustain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/t1mUOeepWNw&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/t1mUOeepWNw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track started the day as something happier, but as it wore on, I just kind of went into my own space of wishing, longing, dreaming, but all at a distance with some strange energy. Not the track I had set off to put together but it might be the track I needed to put together right now. I do like this, and hope that others get something out of it too, but I guess I just had poured a lot more self reflective vibes here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, shout out to MPC Forums, and check out the Beat Battle #321 thread if you want to see what others are up to at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&#34;&gt;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this track was about 90 minutes to put together? A lot of the time was spent chopping, and then finding different lines. I gave a stab at an initial 8 bar sequence and figured it was okay enough. I know I normally go at this as one long sequence, but I really want the sound to change over the course of the track, so although each 8 bar sequence could more or less stand on it&amp;rsquo;s own, I felt it would be fun to make a few different once and then use song mode (for once) to chain them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on trying to figure out where I am having issues with my audio setup, to try and get a hotter signal in my video recordings. So I drew up a rough sketch to see if I could get some notes on what the issue might be and go from there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/audio-setup-sketch.jpg?w=1024&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long component with the knobs/buttons on it that is unlabelled is the Behringer RX1602 that I picked up&amp;hellip; I just forgot to label it apparently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this was my excuse to play with the Strymon Starlight and not make a beat&amp;hellip; I still have time for a beat though :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/8L9Kz-b2efY&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/8L9Kz-b2efY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the patch is *relatively* simple&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s mostly 0chd LFOs running around to just give some movement to the patch, and a DPO running into an RxMx/Optimix so I can ping it, then into a Magneto for some delay, and then into the Starlight for the final pad/wash effect that comes in and goes out. There is a Marbles that is clocked by a Tempi, and the output of the Marbles is being quantized by Harmonaig to generate the pitch on the DPO. The RxMx has the LFOs coming into it to move which oscillator and how much width is being selected. Not much beyond that going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well that was quick, I think I ordered it on Thursday last week, and it showed up today. Just recorded off a few videos checking it out and seeing what it is or is not about. So far, seems like an interesting sound sculpting reverb kind of instrument. I look forward to digging deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3P5SMy9Ul-w&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/3P5SMy9Ul-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the track didn&amp;rsquo;t use the eurorack for much, but I did a bit of processing through it before recording a bunch of audio into the SPs, then chopping that content up on the MPC to actually play it. Given all the noise it became a bit of a hassle to prepare all of the samples on the MPC because it just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the start/end with threshold very well, but it felt like it was worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a somewhat simple lunch break track&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/OvOWOcHukWI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/OvOWOcHukWI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track was so many takes to get to this somewhat still janky state. At least fifteen, and the worst is that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t setup the input/recorder properly to actually capture any takes. I had a good one or two in there, and then realized I was recording off of the microphone and not off of the Zoom H6 inputs. Doh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also fighting with some CV outputs from the MPC to gates into the Pam&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; because&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m rolling my eyes at myself, I had not recorded off the triggers at all. So it was constantly loosing sync, the resets were doing what I wanted, but well&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can get the idea. I really need to create a template for my setup so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep remembering all this twiddly bits that can cause me a problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a long day, day off for my daughter, and some arguments. She&amp;rsquo;s not happy that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for her to eat at Starbucks, and I&amp;rsquo;m not happy to be treated as a piggy bank. So put this together to just decompress and relax a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/&lt;/a&gt;_l0eLSWeR4g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just used the same setup/patch in the eurorack as yesterday, but I did leave the guitar track (on accident) going straight to the outputs. Honestly, it was probably the right choice, but well&amp;hellip; it is what it is :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Been trying to work out some issues, and make tracks louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/vDzTg5h65RI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/vDzTg5h65RI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track I tried to push into using the morphagene for a bit of ambient noise to bring in and out to an okay effect. Probably something that is better to automate with an envelope so have it swell in over time, but that&amp;rsquo;ll mean considering a rewatching of how everything is setup, which I suppose I am due for anyways, since over the last month I have had some grumbles about how some of the gates, attenuators, and other things have been configured. I can effectively get 4 discrete signal paths out to the Befaco STMix, and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve tried applying a path like MPC Live -&amp;gt; Morphagene -&amp;gt; Sqwak Dirty -&amp;gt; Mimeophon -&amp;gt; Data Bender -&amp;gt; STMix, and while this works, it has left Beads out, which I&amp;rsquo;ve then added in by peeling off the signal from Sqwak Dirty -&amp;gt; Beads -&amp;gt; STMix. There is some value in having two discrete paths for the same voice, but I think I need to consider what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get, and which types of sounds or effects make the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on feedback, tried to make this track much louder, and maybe got a little too carried away. Now I think it has pushed into a bit too crunchy and toasty territory. I probably should not have been driving the STMix so hard :/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bass line is only 2 bars long and absolutely needs some variations to move it around, or something to tie off every 4 or 8 bars… just something different. Ah well, this was fun and definitely deserves a second try at thinking about how to drive all the content through the eurorack anyways, and might be something to expand on some more to build out into a set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A day track this time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HbXDBwXj53k&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/HbXDBwXj53k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded off some samples onto the SP-202, slowed them down, and tried to get a bit of the LoFi 1 crunch to get a bit into the Vaporwave space, but this is definitely not 80&amp;rsquo;s inspired or reminiscent… so I guess it is something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resampled the loops back into the MPC so I could line them up better and get everything into sync, then added drums. There&amp;rsquo;s a touch of Mimeophon on the instruments, and the Instruments/Bass/Drums are getting some Data Bender treatment. I suspect the Bass being so dang low is a mixing problem… especially since I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to mix the track. Oops… will save it off and see if it is a track to come back to in the future to refine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scurried off and used loop mode to record me noodling around on the Triton Studio until I found something that felt decent. I ended up unplugging a bunch of patch cables because there was some CV in place that was messing with me, so ended up with about 10 different but similar recordings, but had a lot of accidental drops and other problems. Was trying to hit something a bit more fun and wacky for today&amp;hellip; and I guess I got there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just trying to see how much I could squeeze a track down&amp;hellip; with four tracks and pushing the Mimeophon and Data Bender harder than I usually do&amp;hellip; got some interesting results for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly excited by what came out for the first track so decided to give it another try and see what I could do with the 20 minutes before I have to go pick up my daughter&amp;hellip; like this a bit more :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day and not as much time to dedicate to the track as I&amp;rsquo;d like&amp;hellip; still mostly happy with how it came out though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/24Y1qDwL7X4&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/24Y1qDwL7X4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More of a laid back/chill track for today. With of course, buffers galore, glitch effects, etc&amp;hellip; this required over a dozen practice runs because I was trying to get a bit more movement and hands on with the track, but was causing some incredibly disorienting pitch shifts and swells. The practice helped a lot though, and I think I ended up making a lot less mistakes in this track than some of the previous ones I&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just something a little jazzy, a little funky&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track started out life back in August at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house while visiting, and was a subset of a jam session that I did with my brother in law. Sadly, no guitar or other instrument takes were had, so I had to add in some electric piano, pads, and bells to fill the track out a bit, and give it a bit of a jazzier feel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m abandoning the configuration I am working on for getting multiple tracks together, just that I was getting some more concepts together :D Nothing technically I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before, but this is all tracks that I played out, tweaked notes, velocity and all that fun stuff, to try and get a sound I was going for. Hopefully the levels are working better&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/G7u&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/G7u&lt;/a&gt;_6dGFtv4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been so focussed on trying to just get a track done, or only having a half hour that I kind of just forgot about my original goal of putting a set of tracks together. I certainly played around with it a lot, a month or two ago, but I have been more focussing on just doing a track a day for the last couple of months that it passed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got myself some credits on NeuralBlender&amp;hellip; and actually started buying some art&amp;hellip; whaaaaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to spend some time today trying to think about a way to use the Morphagene as a sample player of some sort&amp;hellip; and got a couple samples going&amp;hellip; didn&amp;rsquo;t go for anything crazy or off the rails&amp;hellip; but they both got some more action today than usual&amp;hellip; so instead of just using them as a passthrough for the MPC outputs, they got some real sounds going&amp;hellip; haha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track gave me some problems. Mostly Total Recall&amp;hellip; I just realized that it triggers or rather changes parameters on the down event of a clock or gate&amp;hellip; and Pam&amp;rsquo;s was sending a gate for 50% of a beat, meaning that the change was happening on 1.3 instead of 1.1 of a bar. Doh! This was giving me all kinds of problems, and I&amp;rsquo;ll need to rethink how I&amp;rsquo;m using Total Recall. The quick fix was to change the gate width from 50% down to 1%, but I still feel like this leaves some margin for error. Back to the drawing board a bit for how I&amp;rsquo;m using Total recall. Surprisingly, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even noticed this until today&amp;hellip; I guess the more ambient sounds just weren&amp;rsquo;t making me notice it so much, but the arp today&amp;hellip; woah boy&amp;hellip; was it messing with my timing&amp;hellip; took a few tries before I got to the &amp;ldquo;is it me, or is it you&amp;rdquo; thought&amp;hellip; I guess at least it wasn&amp;rsquo;t me this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could&amp;rsquo;ve made this into a longer track, but yeah&amp;hellip; I think keeping it short and simple definitely kept it moving and interesting. At least I feel like I got more out of it than I would have otherwise trying to layer a ton of sounds in and then having a big mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively I made the four tracks on the MPC to begin with, and spent the time making sure I was happy with the eight bars first, pretty similar to what I did yesterday. From there I just starting assigning tracks to different outputs on the MPC, and then driving them through different effects in eurorack, and then, as usual, I chased it with the SP 202 and SP 303 at the tail end to just add the dust, grit, and grunge for the song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track was fun, but I also had a lot more time today to be picky with sound selection, make some various sections, and then add in eurorack for some extra spice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/frcc&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/frcc&lt;/a&gt;_5iL7yo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track started from the much cleaner track recorded on soundcloud that I did pretty much everything on the MPC, and then just ran it through and end chain of SP-202 and SP-303. I actually made a few other tracks that didn&amp;rsquo;t make the cut because they just clashed a bit too much with everything going on here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decided to keep it simple today&amp;hellip; really simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all is going on? The picture comes from Neural Blender again&amp;hellip; still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its&amp;rsquo; range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly +4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela&amp;rsquo;s New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; today felt pretty good&amp;hellip; but did like&amp;hellip; five&amp;hellip; maybe six takes&amp;hellip; was getting a bit of a jam going and then would make a mistake&amp;hellip; this take came together pretty well though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/JGcR613&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/JGcR613&lt;/a&gt;_21U&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my pretty traditional setup I&amp;rsquo;ve been going for lately, but with the SP 202 and SP 303 added to the end of the chain&amp;hellip; oh and I&amp;rsquo;ve added in the Zoom H6 at the end of chain to function a bit as a mixer/audio router&amp;hellip; the RCA to 1/4&amp;quot; adaptors are what is causing me the biggest headache in this setup&amp;hellip; but it is kind of nice having the 202 do LPF duties at the end of the chain, and then the Vinyl FX from the 303 to do some compression and wow/flutter duties&amp;hellip; and a hint of vinyl noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still in a kind of meh&amp;hellip; for making music day&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; still having fun and got a chance to mess with Neural Blender some more. So that&amp;rsquo;s nice :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the track&amp;hellip; well I tried to use some automation on Morphagene&amp;hellip; to limited success&amp;hellip; and just ended up dumping the drums and Vox from the MPC out to Sqwak Dirty and Data Bender&amp;hellip; so uhm&amp;hellip; I dunno&amp;hellip; just a simple thing&amp;hellip; but I kind of feel like I need to start from a bit more of a square one and figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m actually interested in doing again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;the music is a bit more pedestrian&amp;hellip; and just Akai MPC Live mk2 all the way baby&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just tired I guess? Having a hard time finding inspiration? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; maybe I just need to sleep better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said&amp;hellip; I guess it&amp;rsquo;s time to head towards the direction of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a track made in Koala Sampler from an auto chopped found sound&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-11-fancy-towel?si=ed4b3b3b61e040c59fa635d5792e7f16&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-11-fancy-towel?si=ed4b3b3b61e040c59fa635d5792e7f16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track is definitely missing some parts (like uh&amp;hellip; bass), that I&amp;rsquo;d normally put in there&amp;hellip; but I only really had about 30 minutes to flesh something out and this was pretty fun to just scrub through and see what would and would not work. With more time I am sure I could find all kinds of cool sounds&amp;hellip; but Koala Sampler only has 64 (well 63 due to needing to have a starting sample) slots to fill&amp;hellip; and I could see scrubbing through by hand being a better result, but auto chopping served me well enough here to go through it&amp;hellip; so there is that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; still tired, but at least off my butt to do some music today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still hitting a problem recording audio&amp;hellip; but I think it is me&amp;hellip; as the two tracks don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the same. I recorded several takes, but somehow the last recording didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to match between the YouTube video and the soundcloud audio&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m doing something wrong. Probably too tired to do everything correctly&amp;hellip; doh!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another drop out&amp;hellip; just a beat focussed on the MPC Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-blood&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-blood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything too fancy going on, just some loops played through the MPC Live&amp;rsquo;s new 2.10 Firmware effect Half Speed, with some extra filtering and effect tweaking to get it into the audio space that I felt would work well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3351</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So uhm&amp;hellip; apparently I forgot how to operate my gear&amp;hellip; clearly what happens when I take a break for a single day and use the pocket operators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/T7jdc69J9G8&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/T7jdc69J9G8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this track I disconnected the entire hot mess from a couple days ago&amp;hellip; and just really went to focus on basics. I decided I wanted to try recording in a few chords into the Morphagene and then using Pam&amp;rsquo;s New Workout on a random LFO to send a change to which splice was selected&amp;hellip; and it works pretty nicely except for one problem. The Morphagene doesn&amp;rsquo;t switch to the next sound until partway through playing&amp;hellip; so either I need to work out clocking issues, or change config.txt settings or&amp;hellip; something. It works fine for this track more or less, but required some playing around and bumbling around to get some rhythm that sounded like it could work with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And now for something completely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uFkvE6DVNqs?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I just decided to do what I could with the pocket operators I have on hand&amp;hellip; PO-32, PO-33, PO-35&amp;hellip; and see what would come from it. I&amp;rsquo;ll definitely get back to the MPC Live and Eurorack, but just needed a change of pace for a bit. Probably will do another PO track or two for the time being and go for something a bit longer, I suspect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah&amp;hellip; not really sure what to make of this&amp;hellip; other than way too many patch cables&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a serious mess. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what I have done any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image is just my work pc&amp;hellip; with a mysterious rocket flying into it? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; I hardly could muster the energy to pull this together. Guess it&amp;rsquo;s just one of those brained out lame tracks&amp;hellip; that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really figure out what to do with it&amp;hellip; and everything I did made it worse. Good thing it was maybe 20 minutes of time invested, instead of a lot of work that would make me sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alright putting this track together was a pain&amp;hellip; I had too many different elements going on, and out of the *nine* recording attempts&amp;hellip; only one was halfway decent. My biggest problem is that about a third of what I put together just didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh with the other parts of the track. I&amp;rsquo;d keep recording and trying to decide which way to go with it, but it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening. The synth lines didn&amp;rsquo;t gel, the Lofi arps didn&amp;rsquo;t gel, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to come together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For this track I built it up off of 16 clips from an expansion, made sure to use each one&amp;hellip; and then did a track explode on the MPC, set the pads 1-8 to output to 5/6 (and thus on the bottom chain of FX of the eurorack), and set pads 9-16 to output to 3/4 (the top chain of FX of the eurorack).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly me just using track mutes from here, and then turning knobs on the eurorack to jam out, cut up, glitch, and otherwise morph and destroy the various elements of the track that are playing. A few places feel like they didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work, but hey&amp;hellip; gotta try right?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Beatober&lt;/em&gt; and time to try and focus a bit more on beats again. Just trying to kick the tires on a stringing a single song together between the Eurorack and Akai MPC Live mk2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/uy&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/uy&lt;/a&gt;_K090EF_g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-01-up-close?si=a78bc5bed4a44a29b9bb9b39fe640180&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-01-up-close?si=a78bc5bed4a44a29b9bb9b39fe640180&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is just from my dog being sleepy on the chair beside me. Felt like a good chill out song and she&amp;rsquo;s not chilling out much more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as putting this all together&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly building out the rack patch, and I setup the Akai MPC outputs 3/4 as the drums going through the top of the rack, and outputs 5/6 for the piano and bass on the bottom of the rack. This is then all going into the ST Mix for mixing a somewhat clean signal together with a copied and glitched out signal. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of knobs to be trying to keep in mind while also muting and unmuting parts, so I probably just need to work out my process a bit more consciously to keep it all in my head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last track/jam for the month&amp;hellip; going to see what I can put together for beatober next :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/in3OUNSvj6U&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/in3OUNSvj6U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time messing around for the month, and wanted to fix up a few things on my patching. For this, I ended up just doing two different track ideas and routing one track through 3/4 of the MPC, and the second track through 5/6 of the MPC. This then went into both the Morphagenes, mostly because it was already hooked up this way. In fact, I tried to mostly use what I&amp;rsquo;ve been building up for a patch over the last two days, but I did straighten out my mixer to have the ST Mix have 1) Track 1 FX chain A 2) Track 1 FX chain B 3) Track 2 FX chain A 4) Track 2 FX chain B. This helped me keep some sanity for which ST Mix knobs were controlling which parts of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some house music&amp;hellip; recorded some of the jam off to the Wav Recorder&amp;hellip; and some of it made it to the YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sunny-side-up&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sunny-side-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is just a quick doodle that I did on my iPad. Just done in ProCreate&amp;hellip;. just now&amp;hellip; while thinking about what to do with this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTZKFYO1Bwg?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a few notes here&amp;hellip; I am routing all of my output on the MPC out either 3/4 or 5/6, and into the Eurorack, and then processing everything through a couple different chains including Morphagene, Mimeophon, Beads, Sqwk Dirty, and Data Bender, and then going out to the ST Mix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use some of the patching done yesterday for the ambient tracks to make some DnB&amp;hellip; woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice Session first&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of mistakes, offbeat content, and a few places that some of the sounds got a bit too wild&amp;hellip; oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/pg0K1Gk5toI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/pg0K1Gk5toI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I did a few more takes and settled on the following take as the &amp;lsquo;final&amp;rsquo; for this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/mgsyQkY1LUk&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/mgsyQkY1LUk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want a higher quality version of the audio for this final (probably) take you can get it at SoundCloud from below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/09/27/jamtember2021-track-floating-above/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another track with the Euro&amp;hellip; and another late night jam session&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/UIBf3vv6FqM&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/UIBf3vv6FqM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Didn&amp;rsquo;t play the patch much, and heck it wasn&amp;rsquo;t even terribly complicated. Mostly just two different sounds loaded into the Morphagenes, one piano loop that I ran through the Beads which gave a kind of organ type of sound, and the other was some bell kind of sound that I ran through the Mimeophon that is making that more low end drone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a straight up Eurorack event today&amp;hellip; nothing else&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Ip&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/Ip&lt;/a&gt;_SaybZesY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the recording that I did on the eurorack, from just a couple of samples in both the Morphagenes and stretched to their limits. There is some digital artifacting or clipping sounds, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest, it is hard to tell if it is coming from something in the chain specifically I am doing wrong, or just a side effect of the Data Bender doing it&amp;rsquo;s thing and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t paying attention to what I had it doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just messing around way more today than I have all month&amp;hellip; but this is for better or worse lol :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Jam Session&amp;hellip; just loaded up a kit and figured I&amp;rsquo;d mess around for 10-15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/gOaEgEJVQDg&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/gOaEgEJVQDg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end I had no idea what I had in the Morphagene buffers, and just kind of went with it. Not really choices I should have made, but whatever&amp;hellip; just messing around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 20:28:14 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3248</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is two takes&amp;hellip; I recorded some YouTube videos and uploaded to soundcloud as well&amp;hellip; take two is better, but just wanted to show what the heck I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/latitude-take-1&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/latitude-take-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And&amp;hellip; here are the YouTube videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Y9hKEfEy244&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/Y9hKEfEy244&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/m9KpYLJNtMU&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/m9KpYLJNtMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; for those who are interested&amp;hellip; finally gettin Beads added to the case and was just messing around with the Beat Slicer mode to see how well it would work by itself and with Data Bender. I&amp;rsquo;m digging it, but feel like I need to get a bit more control over it on the MPC side&amp;hellip; or record some better sequences/patterns into the Eurorack modules (Pams/Tete/Mimetic Digitalis&amp;hellip; whatever)&amp;hellip; or not. Definitely going to keep trying but I feel like this was a bit too much glitch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;hellip; the MPC Live mk2 rarely crashes on me&amp;hellip; and lost some work&amp;hellip; I suspect I know what I did&amp;hellip; but *sigh*&amp;hellip; anyways&amp;hellip; regrouped and did this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture is from the trip to Yellowstone&amp;hellip; I mean&amp;hellip; if you ever can&amp;hellip; you got to go. Just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah yeah yeah&amp;hellip; another vaporwave style&amp;hellip; and I swear, I&amp;rsquo;ll get some videos up of the process I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;hellip; honestly nothing too fancy, but I should probably see if I can get something similar to work just within the MPC instead of needing two&amp;hellip; retro/older&amp;hellip; Boss SPs&amp;hellip; yet&amp;hellip; it is frequently working&amp;hellip; so what do I know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; needed to try something different&amp;hellip; and this is both short and way out there&amp;hellip; but kind of dig it more than the last track for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; you literally have to smile when you hear the song and see the pic together&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s like illegal or something if you don&amp;rsquo;t. Now&amp;hellip; you don&amp;rsquo;t have to like either individually, but as a total package&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/dont-forget-grandma&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/dont-forget-grandma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my grandmother, or as many people knew her, as the world&amp;rsquo;s grandma. She was a great woman who cared for everybody. Honestly, she was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; just standard song duty for the day, kinda hit or miss again for me&amp;hellip; probably time to push myself in another direction, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to see what happens if I just do the same style/process for a month. What I think is happening is that I&amp;rsquo;m getting faster at the process, but also getting pickier&amp;hellip; who&amp;rsquo;d have thought?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; this kind of went into the DnB direction&amp;hellip; and I just gave it a shot&amp;hellip; takes 30 seconds to come together, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really great&amp;hellip; but maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/everything-hurts&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/everything-hurts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the picture. Well this is my friend bee. Found the poor guy hanging out on my deck post, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t flying away. So I gave him some honey, which he ate up for a while. Later the honey and the bee were gone. Either I saved the bee&amp;rsquo;s life in its&amp;rsquo; time of need, or I ended up attracting something bigger that ate the bee. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. But as my friend, I am going to imagine that I saved the bee, and in the future he&amp;rsquo;s going to communicate to his bee buddies that I helped save his life and that he&amp;rsquo;ll return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well not really what I meant to do&amp;hellip; had a sample prepared on the 202&amp;hellip; and then in a rush I deleted it&amp;hellip; yo&amp;hellip; not my finest. Next time I need to leave a sticky note or something for something *face palm*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; this was&amp;hellip; I dunno&amp;hellip; just another thing tossed together. Haven&amp;rsquo;t been feeling some of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together, but still committing to doing something, anything&amp;hellip; at least once a day. And folks are posting for beatober&amp;hellip; do I go for it? Maybe&amp;hellip; but gonna have to do something different, cuz I&amp;rsquo;m definitely finding it hard to squeeze the time in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day kicked my butt so far&amp;hellip; so wasn&amp;rsquo;t really full of energy to put something together. Well that&amp;rsquo;s not quite right&amp;hellip; I recorded off a start, and then put the last component of my eurorack case &amp;ldquo;Tape Grain Glitch&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; so getting stuff done, but just really feeling tired today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just knocked this out in maybe 30 minutes&amp;hellip; the mix is a bit off, definitely some of the parts could use some filtering or eq&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; gotta keep rolling these things out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I just used the picture from a website&amp;hellip; sue me&amp;hellip; well don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; but I didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to have eight lambic around to photograph&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another track in the vaporwave style&amp;hellip; or rather&amp;hellip; dumping some loops/sounds into the SP-202 and making something pitched down&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m probably abusing this too much by now for making a track a day for the month&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; if it works? Keep on filtering? Keep on trying out the new synths on the MPC from 2.10? I mean heck yeah!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; weird glitchy noise track :D. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t go nuts with bit crushing or anything&amp;hellip; yeah me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/wake-the-giant&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/wake-the-giant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture is a filtered statue&amp;hellip; from Chicago&amp;hellip; I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track is literally just a bunch of glitchy noises that I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to see if I could put together into a track. Had to take the time to put some of the samples into Key Groups so I could actually play everything together&amp;hellip; in as much of a tune as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shot off a second track for the day&amp;hellip; this time some DnB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my daughter&amp;rsquo;s teddy bear, from years ago when we took a train ride in northern New Hampshire. Tea and scones were absolutely had, at this simply fabulous tea party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track was pretty simple&amp;hellip; just did my vaporwave thing&amp;hellip; found four loops that seemed to work together&amp;hellip; though this admittedly took a while today&amp;hellip; because I tried five or six combinations that seemed fine, but when recorded as Lofi on the SP-202 and then slowed down they sounded quite poor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not exactly sure what I was trying to do here&amp;hellip; but this is all inside the MPC&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/constant-barrage&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/constant-barrage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a picture of one of my dogs eyeballs&amp;hellip; really close up&amp;hellip; hah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track was really just taking some samples, a few of them run through the SP-202, and then seeing what I could put together. In particular I spent a lot more time on the drums in the SP-202, with a bit of added distortion from the SP-303 to just give them a bit more punch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mostly happy with how this track came out&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/always&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/always&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture is just of the SP-202&amp;hellip; just thought it looked kinda cool all lit up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track itself came together pretty quickly, though I did have to go tweak a number of samples once I ran it through YAM&amp;hellip; all of a sudden I was noticing all kinds of clipping and noise. The atmospheric sound at the beginning was full of so many pops and clips. I didn&amp;rsquo;t remove all of them, but definitely reduced it a bit by just tweaking the program. The bass was just super noisy, probably as a result from having run it through the SP-202 a bit, so I had to drop a LPF on it to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something that I was working on last month, and dug up to make sure it got completed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flexing&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flexing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from the zoo we visited in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track itself I worked on while visiting my sister and came about from trying to prep some content for jamming with my brother in law. We got a couple good jam sessions in, but nothing recorded. This particular track was something that I was just up in the morning messing with and had saved off for a while and figured it was something worth saving to work on and finishing later. Up at 6am this morning, got a long day ahead, and figured it was as good a time as any to run it across the finish line!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just another quick one&amp;hellip; really dug the time stretched loop and figured I&amp;rsquo;d drop another quick sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/check-your-inbox&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/check-your-inbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, just worked through sampling a few loops into the SP 202, then PITCH and FILTER 1 to taste, and then running it through the SP 303 for some extra flavor as usual. Hype came in for the rescue for a few other sounds just to round it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know, two tracks in one day&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m having too much fun making fake vaporwave tracks with the SPs, and my second power adaptor showed up so I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to hook back up the Boss SP-303 as well. This lead to making this song with both the 202 and 303. Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another picture from Hawaii, but I ran it through a stormy PS Camera filter. This particular picture was from the helicopter ride, so dang fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just four samples&amp;hellip; most of which I ran through the SP-202 and pitched down and used the filter, some chopping, and nothing else too fancy. Honestly, just wanted to put together some 8 bar loops and see where things went from there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one was a blast to put together&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ash-left-on-my-face&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ash-left-on-my-face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is a photoshop filter on a record. So nothing&amp;hellip; exactly exciting&amp;hellip; but well&amp;hellip; whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this track together was a bit of work digging for samples and finding stuff that I liked. The hardest thing was actually pulling the bass together. Originally I had a non stop sound, and was applying different gated filters, and it just felt wrong. Like it should belong to an electronic or techno sound. It was nice by itself, but just not for this track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just knocking something out fairly quickly over lunch for day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from years ago&amp;hellip; Aruba I think? I&amp;rsquo;ll have to look it up and see if I can figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the track, I did another fake 4 bar loop to turn into a vaporwave track. So quite similar process to the last few days. The big difference here is *way* more automation, filtering, and for the first half of the song I used the Air Halfspeed plugin to make the vaporwave component feel slower. The whole track was going much much slower than I usually go for, so I really just tried to lock in what felt like a leaned way back vibe and go with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well today I felt like messing around with making a vaporwave styled song&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another picture courtesy of my trip to Hawaii. Really gorgeous island, and could definitely just hang out at the beach for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make vaporwave you usually take some old 80&amp;rsquo;s music, find a loop, time stretch it way down, and then drop a beat on top of it&amp;hellip; maybe some filtering, reverb, or other fx to boot, but the idea is super easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expecting today to be a bit crazy, and I woke up early. So got the dogs out, and decided to get to business. Dogs out at 6:00am, fed, and in front of the MPC by 6:10am. Looking at the clock now and it is 6:52am. So factoring for upload time and stuff&amp;hellip; I guess a 35 minute track from start to finish?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from my trip with my family to Hawaii. Was taking an early morning walk with my wife and saw the bird up in the tree. Not sure what kind of bird it is, but it was definitely striking!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did some of the work yesterday for this track&amp;hellip; just happened to have some extra time to kick it off. Then today&amp;hellip; happened. A lot going on, but I really wanted to get some more going for the track by adding a few more sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from Hawaii, and I had gotten my wife a coconut to drink. She loves it&amp;hellip; I keep trying to drink coconut water, but frankly it is not for me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is healthy, but just not my thing. My wife can drink it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner though!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is another one from the walk. Just some train tracks that I had to walk over, and look like a good time to snap a quick picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly though, what I had for lunch. Chicken Tikka Masala, and boy did it hit the spot! Sure it was store bought, packaged, and needed to be reheated, but it is what I had available at the time, or I could have had some fajita leftovers, but I think I am saving those for tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This should get me within striking distance of, six tracks left to do afterwards I think&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to try and just hit that before the end of the month. Maybe do a couple tracks a day to fill it out :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my 6 mile walk the other day&amp;hellip; just took a ton of pictures that I figured might come in handy for interesting song images. The empty discarded bottle on the side of the street just seemed interesting enough to me that I walked by it, turned around, and came back to take a picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3000</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yorgos just released the 2.0.2 mastering suite for the Akai MPC Live/X/One using some of the new features in the 2.10 firmware. If you already have the suite you should have gotten an email, and he also posted some information on the MPC Forums thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=189006&#34;&gt;YA MASTERING TEMPLATE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is what I just posted in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=189006&amp;amp;start=180&#34;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;, but adding here for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a track with and without using the YA Mastering Template 2.0.2. Anything that sounds bad here is frankly on me for not taking a bit more time to adjust and get the sonics under control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Hungers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/08/26/track-hungers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 18:39:00 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=3006</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track started while I was out visiting my sister and her family last week. Was just sitting on a chair and knocking out some sounds to see what would stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/hungers&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/hungers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a library, the venting looked interesting so a snapped a picture. Ran it through a Ps Camera filter (elements?) just to see how it would look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is a mix of loops I grabbed, and loading up some synths and using pad performer to try and get some other sounds in tune with the loops I was grabbing. Not rocket science, but the way that the loops were reported as a key in the MPC Sample Edit section made it a bit awkward to figure a few things out. Mostly because the MPC refuses to acknowledge flats, so it always thinks everything is sharp. Not a big deal per se, but it can mean that you&amp;rsquo;ve got to think through what key/note range it thinks content is in and then break it down into what you are actually going to play. Sure if you do it right it all matches up regardless if you are sharp or flat, but it can mean that the way you think about some of the notes is just off, if that makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just posted a video up on some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve done over the last few weeks to experiment with getting the new MPC line to talk with Eurorack and get everything in sync. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing to fancy or special, but felt like this might be useful for others who are trying to figure out how to do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is interest, I&amp;rsquo;ll work on putting another post together to outline the details more fully, but this just seemed like a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around trying to get an Ambient DnB setup working, and ended up thinking the concept might fit well with the MPC Forums Beat Battle 315 this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the two live played recordings that I took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: So I decided to do a third iteration of the track, because all the tapping noises were bugging me. Anyways&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s revision three.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The short answer to the question is NO, you cannot have multiple audio interfaces hooked up to your iPad. At least this is probably not going to work the way that you want. I was hoping to use the iPad to route audio around between the iPad, OP-Z, and OP-1, but alas, it&amp;rsquo;s not quite meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aum&#34;&gt;AUM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video I show what happens when you try to do this in AUM, and it is a complete bust, whatever the iPad recognized as the last audio device is the one, and only one, that it will recognize. End of Story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This video shows how to sync up your MPC Live mk2/X/One over CV gates to a Pamela&amp;rsquo;s New Workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not too worried about the variance in the BPM that shows up at higher levels. I&amp;rsquo;ve monitored the gates being sent over CV and have seen that it is not dropping gates, so over time the average will be correct, even if there is a small variance in the BPM at a specific gate trigger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=211301&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt; DokBrown asked about making kicks and bass mono, and the impacts on making a better sounding mix/master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think for home studio creation, your bass or kick being mono doesn&amp;rsquo;t terribly matter. A reason to consider making your bass or kick mono might be if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a cross over to/from your subwoofer, making your low end sounds mono, but beyond that, I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of old school information floating around as the right way to get &amp;ldquo;that sound&amp;rdquo;. So yes, there absolutely are tons of reasons to make your kicks and bass mono, but there isn&amp;rsquo;t really a good reason to do it &amp;ldquo;just because&amp;rdquo;. Certainly do it if you want to, and better if you have specific reasons for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;internal-storage&#34;&gt;Internal Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am moving this to the top, as a warning to MPC buyers. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off from buying the device, but just to help keep your sanity if you are thinking of purchasing one or have just purchased one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Messing around with the bass side of things, and liked how this was sounding. I tried to sample the space that had the most interesting sound to it, and going into the high end it rather tails off around C3 to C4&amp;hellip; so don&amp;rsquo;t expect to use this as a lead by and stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-bass-bottoms-up.zip&#34;&gt;NT-Bass-Bottoms Up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-bass-bottoms-up.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a bit of time adjusting the ADSR, it was on the edge of popping on the attack, and I adjusted the release so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just abruptly stop. These changes were made in the program, so you can undo them if you want to keep the character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=2793</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was kind of hunting around for a bit of an accordion sound, and figured this was close enough to a synthetic sound as I was going to make with the modular case today. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to the NT-Modular-Wet Lazers key group I put together, just a few patch changes for how the filter operates and which wave table I was using out of the Disting EX Plus Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-be-spoke-accordian.zip&#34;&gt;nt-modular-be-spoke-accordian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-be-spoke-accordian.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; queue up the kinda cheesy FX sounds&amp;hellip; this is mostly just the Disting EX routed through Squawk Dirty To Me for filtering. Honestly it&amp;rsquo;s not *that* special, but I did do a little bit of LFO routing into a VCA into the resonance CV control to get that slight vibration sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-wet-lazers.zip&#34;&gt;nt-modular-wet-lazers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-wet-lazers.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did try briefly to see if it was quick to use velocity CV out from the MPC, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it working with just a few knob twiddles, so frankly&amp;hellip; I failed at it. Going to need a bit more reading of the manual again to see how to get it going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still taking a break from wrist issues, but I had some time to throw together a new drum kit. Baggin is a few different sounds I was messing with elsewhere, and probably don&amp;rsquo;t really go together, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to try and put a track together. Likely it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a bit of FX and filter to tame, but I figured I&amp;rsquo;d post up the samples for anybody who is interested. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the pads color coded, so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll help you around the patch a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=2781</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a super simple patch I put together on the modular, simple because this smaller case only has a handful of modules in it. While it isn&amp;rsquo;t complete yet, I wanted to test out and see how well it did or did not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-last-breath.zip&#34;&gt;NT-Modular-Last Breath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-last-breath.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound is basically an oscillator running on the Disting EX in dual mode, so that I could also get an envelope generator, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have that in this case at the moment. The oscillator is fed into the VCA, which is modulated by an LFO running positive on the Left channel, and running negative on the Right channel, this creates a kind of panning tremolo effect. I think routed that audio output into another pair of VCAs so that I could control the volume by the envelope. From there, the audio is running into a stereo filter to augment the sound a bit and give it some resonance to adjust the sound a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well folks, I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to try and help you out for questions in the comments. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this Synth One specific video helps. I suspect that the issue with the MPC not seeing audio is due to the user not hooking up the audio outputs from their iPad/iPhone to the MPC, but just a guess. Hopefully this will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Midi only carries note data such as what note number and velocity, it does not carry audio information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick video to walk you through how to sync a Teenage Engineering OP-1 to an Akai MPC Live/X/One over USB. The steps are pretty straightforward, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to add the steps below as well for those that would prefer to skip the video and just want some text to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akai MPC Live/X/One Setup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On you&amp;rsquo;re MPC, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to head over to the menu by pressing the MENU button. This will get you into your normal menu. You can choose to have the top middle setting SYNC to Off or something else, but personally I&amp;rsquo;d just turn it off since in this case we just want the MPC to control the master sync.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Personally I shopped around and was able to get it with discounts/sales at Best Buy a year ago for $60. It does give you a lot of features though, so definitely worth checking out if it is compatible with your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Took my family to Boston, left the dogs home. Came back to the dogs having eaten up my notebook. Like WTF&amp;hellip; we were an hour late from your usual feeding time, was it necessary to eat up my Hobonichi? Fortunately they didn&amp;rsquo;t eat up any important notes, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure Tomo River paper is good for their digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the month, not really sure what this track is, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the *shrug* whatever&amp;hellip; it is the end of the month, and I ran out of time for the day to really pull something together. Guess I need to live with my failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from my daughter walking away from me going to the mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wrist is still really sore. Talked to the nurse, they can get me in to see me in about a week. Said to try some Ibuprofen in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think hitting the pads is causing me problems, this is similar to some issues I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past, but far more extreme. Not really sure, but stretching seems to help. Also trying to avoid typing quite so much for work. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Still sucks hitting the pads, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to take a bit more mind of hitting the pads. I want to finish off the month and not have too much &amp;ldquo;junk&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably spent more time than I should have, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t help my right wrist much, but I&amp;rsquo;m really trying to figure out where the pain is, and if it is more from typing, sitting at a desk, hitting stuff, or what. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I have CTS or something, but the palm of my hand is sore, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention before but my right index finger is now cold. That started about a week ago, the coldness, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another picture of the 3 string my dad made for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not in great shape wrist wise, hitting the pads sucks, but I wanted to pull something out, and at least I&amp;rsquo;m happy enough with it. Just tried to keep it super simple and not worry about it, so I can worry about myself. Going to try and end out the month, but need to take care of myself as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am legit concerned I have permanent damage in my wrist. I wanted to work on this track and the day was already rough, couldn&amp;rsquo;t pull anything else together. This is my post of shame. Peace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to get more done, but my wrist is absolutely killing me. Not sure if I pulled something, popped something, strained it, or just getting old. I really dig what I started here but I cannot handle tapping, typing or anything out. Might be done guys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Okay forehead. Yes it is mine&amp;hellip; some picture of me with sunglasses, and probably thinking about how cool I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of basic, and maybe a little too stripped down, and yet I got something together. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just not feeling it really. A lot is going on and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I am going to finish the month off or not. Deal with it? I am dealing with it, but a track a day, plus family, plus a full-time job&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a lot sometimes. Especially when you don&amp;rsquo;t get started until the end of the day to make a track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, a dead spider in a glass. I think I used the picture before&amp;hellip; so sue me :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stab at the LoFi sound, this one has a bit too much going on, but I do like the worn out sound, and had fun going different places in the different sections. Another one that feels like a pretty good stab at moving more towards a finished track than I have been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The image is a double exposure. My nephew painting me an Isaac for Christmas, and I got around to hanging it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, well it&amp;rsquo;s wonky and glitched out a bit, but was something fun and mysterious. Have to see what to do with it next!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just an error code from my printer. Why? Well why not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the track goes&amp;hellip; is this space elevator music? I have no idea, but it sure is cheery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of some wrapping paper I think&amp;hellip; boy I forget what I took it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, wanted to try a dark LoFi kind of sound, and I kind of like what I nailed here, but the mix is too low, and it really needs some mastering to kick it into gear. Feels like something that&amp;rsquo;s near where I&amp;rsquo;d want a completed track to be though, so I dig it :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s my mouth&amp;hellip; hah&amp;hellip; no screaming though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where this came from, but it just felt like a goofy kind of Summer DJ track to me. Not sure what to do with it, it probably needs some more high end sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a bill that my dog ate. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I know the one. I&amp;rsquo;ve taped the bill back together, so it ought to be legal tender, but it just looked like something worth using for a track image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a ton of fun working on grooving with this track, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s on the list of something I really need to get back on and turn it into something to finish as a track. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve got some work in front of me to get all these things moving :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I just scribbled this down in a notebook to get the picture&amp;hellip; nothing fancy, but I needed some kind of artwork and had no other idea what to do. Seems kinda cool though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the track itself, I wanted to spend some more time putting together the track, so there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more elements going on and it feels like a bit more complete of an idea to me at least. The Vox is okay&amp;hellip; I suppose I should&amp;rsquo;ve taken out the high end synth&amp;hellip; and just recorded my own vocals. Next time I do a month of tracks, probably need to force myself to do my own vocals and see where I go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I literally cannot believe that it snowed today. But then again, welcome to New England baby&amp;hellip; the snow didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long, but we got probably 4-5 inches. Enough to notice and stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to make something chill for the day, so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing too crazy, but just kind of a laid back vibe. I mean yeah&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ve probably got the last day of snow for the season&amp;hellip; better relax and enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alright&amp;hellip; first&amp;hellip; I really had fun on this track, as short as it is. This feels like something I want to come back to and finish when I have some proper time to focus on it. The intent was to get something kind of light and refreshing&amp;hellip; and I feel like this hit that itch for me. Just a nice little wall of sounds all working together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just a silly little doodle I had done in my notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, just trying to work out something a bit wonky and that felt off kilter today. I kind of dig the vibe, though I don&amp;rsquo;t know so much about the Vox. The track needed some vocals, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s something better to go in here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I got it in my head to try and do a bit of a disco track. The track kind of has the funk a bit, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s missing an element or two to make it really scream disco. As it stands, it feels like it is missing half the band, but I was running out of time to put something together and just wanted to see where this could get me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of a 3 string cigar box guitar my dad made for me. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get to work better for some time. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into it in a blog post somewhere, but my dad didn&amp;rsquo;t align a few parts correctly, so it needs some love!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the song, I was really just trying to go for a straight up hip hop/break beat kind of sound, and keep it moving. I like the track overall, but think it could use some stripping back of a few elements, and maybe add something a little different? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, seems like something I am poking on a bit for what I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together lately. Time for some self reflection?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, an MPC Forums Beat Battle&amp;hellip; I honed in on a section that I thought would loop well enough, chopped it up, and then focussed on the chops that sounded good enough. This track turned into three different sections that I just used song mode to string together. Was a fun track to flip, even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly spend a ton of time working on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alright this track is just me messing around with FX&amp;hellip; mostly delay, and trying to make something that feels happier. I know it is super goofy, but it was fun to put together. Probably needs to be peeled back a little on that arp/synth part&amp;hellip; or get it&amp;rsquo;s own section to fill out&amp;hellip; but this just put a smile on my face while working on it :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from a trip to Greece I took two years ago with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was trying to put something a bit more LoFi sounding together, and I kind of feel like I failed. The mix is just off, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel dirty enough. Overall, I find the bass too loud and it probably needs some major taming. What was I thinking? Uhm&amp;hellip; not sure lol!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For this track I was trying to think about transitions between sections a bit more, and trying to see how it would come together. I kind of think the higher end synth sound is a bit distracting, and the track would probably be better without it. Maybe a few too many elements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy with the track feeling a bit more funky though, and trying to add in a few more somewhat random sounds moving in and out feels like a good effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 8! Trying something different for a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the image comes courtesy of my dogs chewing up my daughter&amp;rsquo;s homework. She had left it someplace where they could get at it, and while I was out at the recycling center they decided to have a snack apparently. It looks like she was making a song for her class as part of an assignment, but she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tell me what it was for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simple Yet Effective</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A simple track for a simple day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/simple-yet-effective&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/simple-yet-effective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is just some loops I selected and put together. Nothing crazy, but I was looking to make something with some different sounds than I usually put together and see what I could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on the fence about that noise loop chopped up, it adds some interesting ambience to the track, but I think I could have done something different with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another track for day six, and way happier with how this came out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who said you can only do one track a day max? I had about 30 minutes free and ripped this one. I dig how it came out compared to the other track. I think most of what I like about it is that it&amp;rsquo;s simpler, and while it is pretty in your face, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have quite so much going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=2570</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 6, and put this together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another Boss SP 303 sampled song, I spent a *lot* of time sampling into the SP 303, and then resampled back into the MPC. There are some things that I like here, but boy was it a lot of work, and honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the result was entirely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like some of the sounds and how they came out, but I feel like this is not really that great. The Vox probably could use more work to make it different or change over time, and this is where I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m hitting a bit of a wall with producing exclusively on the MPC right now. Just a bit too much work to pull the audio apart and do something different with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day five of #jampril2021 and still going. Made another drum kit and posted it up on the discord server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/big-hammer&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/big-hammer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track was still hitting it into the Boss SP 303 and just recording off more samples for the FX. Definitely getting faster at sampling into the 303 and then resampling back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried track mutes with timing corrects which worked out alright&amp;hellip; then doubled up the track and layered in a new track with some additional sounds/enhancements to spice things up. The mix is a bit off, but happy enough with how the track came out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is day four track&amp;hellip; and another one working with the SP 303 to sample and mess with the FX a bit. What did I do exactly? Uh&amp;hellip; not sure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/breathing-in&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/breathing-in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another track of sampling into the SP 303, and running effects and stuff, and then sampling back into the MPC to make a finished drum kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played everything out with the Track Mute again&amp;hellip; but this time used TC. It helped a bit&amp;hellip; at least making it more obvious where problems were. Would try again hah.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 3&amp;hellip; This track I mostly wanted to mess around with the Boss SP 303 to understand the sampling workflow a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/where-my-boys&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/where-my-boys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is Isaac from the game &amp;ldquo;The Binding of Isaac&amp;rdquo;. Cool kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this together I drove samples into the SP 303 C and D banks. They are much faster to sample on, even though it is still quite slow compared to modern standards. It was a pretty good way to test out the repair job that I did for the pads as well, since I was bouncing around a lot of the buttons, minus the pattern stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much I care to bother with pattern sequencing here when I can just resample everything into the MPC. So I filled up all 16 smart media sample slots between bank C and D&amp;hellip; The samples came in between a mix of raw, and sometimes with some effects already running, and I did end up adding effects on the way out back into the MPC as well to make a drum kit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had 30 minutes&amp;hellip; and knocked out a second quick track for day two. What am I thinking?! I could have saved this for tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to this&amp;hellip; just roped in some different expansion sounds&amp;hellip; the synth and the bass from the MPC Juno sound pack. The drums&amp;hellip; I forget. If I remember I will look it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really just knocked this out by laying out the drums and the chords in the drum kit really quick, and then loading up the two synth sounds. I setup pad performer notes at Gb Major just to knock it all out hopefully in tune, and then put it through the ringer of expanding the track to 64 bars and then track muting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a Boss SP 303, which was obviously used. It showed up, and it smells like either a musty arcade, or somebody&amp;rsquo;s basement. Clearly the SP has been in storage for a *long* time, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that the scent is going away. The description for the SP 303 was Very Good condition, but when it arrived some of the pads were shot. Most importantly, the record pad just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just some flowers that my wife bought&amp;hellip; Calla Lilies if you&amp;rsquo;re interested. We&amp;rsquo;re trying to get more flowers in the house and make it feel more like home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, this is straight up another MPC Live track. I grabbed a handful of samples and just got to chopping. I know I could have done a better job getting some of the slices together, but I tried to do it by ear as much as possible, and hey, I continue to approve of the slightly wonky and janky sound. So it was a lot of using the threshold chop mode to get the party started, and then adjusting the start/end points a bit by ear. I know for sure that a few of the mistakes in the chops came from forgetting to turn off the linked slices afterwards, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing much for tracks over the last TWO months, which has gotten me quite a bit out of practice. Only done a few hit or miss beat battles in between, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even bothered to write up a post about them. Well, I do need to get myself more focussed again&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being foolish, and figuring it is time for me to get back to a track a day. It is my punishment for being lazy for three months and hardly doing any tracks. To be fair I did move over the last three months, had no internet for a month, and was busy building shelving throughout the house, including an at least 30 hour project building a pantry. Excuses excuses&amp;hellip; now I need to get back off my butt!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The track itself is a great mix of different synths, pads, chords, percussion, and other elements. You can go quite a few different ways for this beat battle for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on this track over a couple of days. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure what I wanted to do with it, but figured I&amp;rsquo;d dirty up the track a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I put this Drum Kit together with the intent of making it quite noisy in mind.  It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more of a harsh industrial kind of sound, so you&amp;rsquo;re likely going to want to apply effects to tame these sounds a bit.  A lot of what makes it rough was running the sounds through sample frequency reduction and a pretty heavy level of compression.  This gives the tails of the sounds an especially unnatural nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A drum kit I put together using a few scripts I threw together to try and help package all of this content up a bit neater so I can focus more on the samples and post content.  Right now I know I&amp;rsquo;m not writing anything terribly interesting, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the demo tracks I&amp;rsquo;m putting together show off the sample packs a bit.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be considering documenting up the process to get the samples together, but then again, maybe it isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly interesting.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track was just to mess around with recording onto the Akai S950 at a ridiculous bandrate and pitched up a lot so I could get most of the track into the S950 to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb304-lucky-number&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb304-lucky-number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the track is pretty muddy, and a bit of a mess, but whatever I had fun putting it together. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that there is anything worth digging into for production techniques because it was mostly just finding sections that kind of worked, looping some content, and messing with FX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just testing a few things on the VX90/S950 combo setup and figured I would record off a few key groups to see how things were sounding. Below are the files if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in checking them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that Cherry Crush was the first key group that I recorded yesterday after getting everything setup and working again. I recorded a sample into the S950 and then worked on tweaking the filter and resonance to see what kind of sweet spots I could find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A pad I put together as my first pass at making an BY-SA key group.  Definitely going to need to make some tools to simplify the process, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see how it works out after doing the next three sample packs for the month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent a few hours messing around with the configuration, and trying to get everything to work. It is not exactly straight forward, and I had to dig through a lot of old posts and try and understand what exactly different sources were trying to tell me. I found a few that indicated that it should work polyphonically, but didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly describe the steps to get there, or said things a little too generically. I can say, I now have it all working (yeah!), and will go through how to get this setup step by step, where you might hit a few problems, suggestions to test out issues. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Folks seem to be unhappy with the Q-Link overlay that was added into the Akai MPC Live/Live II/One firmware. While it is handy, it can put this overlay over the end of a sample you are trying to edit as soon as you touch the Q-Link, and can be about as annoying as it is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn it off, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get into the Preferences Menu, go into General, and scroll down to the bottom and look for &amp;ldquo;SHOW QLINK STATUS WHEN TOUCHED&amp;rdquo;, and remove the check mark. This will enable/disable this feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of a trip I took with my family and in-laws to a butterfly garden when the kids were just two or three. The girls really loved seeing all the insects in their natural habitat. Especially since it was winter outside, and in some sections nearly tropical from the level of humidity. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see the life cycle of these sometimes so foreign creatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This Sample Pack is intended as a drum kit that I put together as my first pass at making a BY-SA licensed Sample Pack.  Definitely going to need to make some tools to simplify the process, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see how it works out after doing the next three sample packs for the month before I get too ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I kicked off a discussion over on MPC Forums &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;amp;t=210454&#34;&gt;Akai VX 90&lt;/a&gt;. There was some interest in the LPF/Resonance, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just do a quick video. Definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t illustrate the entire scope of the resonance, but just to give a quick idea of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/NMUUltOa6gY&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/NMUUltOa6gY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just showing off the Tauntek Custom Firmware I recently installed, and access to using CCs to control parameters. In particular I setup two Q-Links to control both the low pass filter and resonance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking off and on for an Akai VX 90, and finally found one. Probably paid too much, but wanted to hook one up to my Akai S950, so there will be that, once I get the cable in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last couple of days just playing around with it, reading the manual, and trying to get my brain around how it works. As you can see from the featured image, the interface is a bit sparse, and not a whole lot of direction as to what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just about to go to bed&amp;hellip; not sure I could&amp;rsquo;ve cut this more to the wire&amp;hellip; but&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; I got close lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just drums from outside&amp;hellip; everything else was sampled from the track with an application of vigorous effects and automation where I felt I could get away with it and still have a cohesive track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New MPC-Forums poster DCS created the post &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;amp;t=210413&amp;amp;p=1824936#p1824936&#34;&gt;WHY LOOPINGS&lt;/a&gt; ~ &amp;ldquo;As an absolute beginner i would like to understand why loopings are used instead of tracks for beats. What are the advantages and do you use loopings for any music genre?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I somewhat wonder if this is some form of spam, it is a good question (as I interpret it), and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d respond and it felt like a good topic for my blog to dig into a bit further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick video to build on my last post &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2021/02/03/akai-mpc-live-x-one-bluetooth-midi-with-an-ipad/&#34;&gt;Akai MPC Live/X/One Bluetooth MIDI With an iPad&lt;/a&gt; where I had describe how to get a Bluetooth MIDI connection working. In this post I will cover how to quickly get audio out of your iPad into your MPC, and get the MIDI connection over bluetooth to control/sequence the synthesizer on your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recorded another video to go along with the post. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to follow step by step instructions I&amp;rsquo;ll also write them up after the video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So… like a lunatic, I just wrapped up two months in a row of making and publishing a track a day.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in what I did last month, go check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2020/12/31/reflection-on-jamcember-2020-challenge/&#34;&gt;#jamcember2020&lt;/a&gt; post. My goal was to publish a track to soundcloud, that no matter how good or bad, I was putting something up.  Trust me, there are some stinkers up there, but I also managed to put some content up that I think sounds great and stands on its own pretty well!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of funny&amp;hellip; because after doing the two months of making a track a day back to back&amp;hellip; I feel like my flow has transitioned to just putting stuff down in a different sort of way, making it a bit more raw&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a few years back, when Amy was more of a spring chicken. she&amp;rsquo;s still quite an active dog, but she definitely prefers to be laying down on a lap, or being held. Still curious to explore and see new things, but not quite so bold as she once was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been nice to have a few days off from making a track a day, to be able to think a bit more about what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and putting a track together. I still want to do a month two lessons learned for #jamuary2021&amp;hellip; maybe tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll pull my thoughts together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a long time ago, my daughter and I were under a blanket with a flashlight trying to make scary faces. Good times, and nobody got scared. She was a fun kid. I was trying to figure out a good place to use the picture, and this one seemed to be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting up Midi over Bluetooth and the MPC is dead simple, and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d take some time to make a quick video and write this up for everybody else to enjoy. You&amp;rsquo;ve at least got to give it a try! I kicked this video off from a post Dan B made over at MPC Forums &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=210326&amp;amp;p=1824493#p1824493&#34;&gt;Connecting iPad &amp;amp; EXT Midi Controllers to MPC Live&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just recorded a video to show how to setup Bluetooth Midi between an Akai MPC Live/X/One and an iPad. I have done these steps with an iPhone as well, and suspect that it would work just fine with plenty of other devices that support Midi over Bluetooth as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second 264kb challenge track I put together and dropped over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=210304&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt;, and a bit more focussed on an experimental sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of a cigar box style guitar my dad made for me for my birthday last year. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly stayed in my closet, though once in a while I have taken it out. There&amp;rsquo;s something a bit messed up with it though, and it honestly needs some TLC. I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what the problem is with it, so that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a problem for me to fix it. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to bring it back to him and see if he can figure out what needs to be done to fix it. If I recall&amp;hellip; the pickups are a bit wonky and not ping up one of the strings very well&amp;hellip; though it could be something else. What does this have to do with the track? Nothing&amp;hellip; just thought it was a kind of need picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My first entry is a chip tune track, and I tried to use effects that would make this sound like an old 8-bit/16-bit track. It is not authentic, but I was trying to impart some of the low end grit. If you want to check out what I threw together for the track the project files are available here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last day for #jamuary2021&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to look towards doing some more music still, but probably at a slower pace so that I can focus on tracks a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/quiet-heart&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/quiet-heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is of the fire pit that we built&amp;hellip; going to miss it when we move to the new house, but we&amp;rsquo;ll create another one :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track came together pretty quickly while I was watching my daughter play the sims, make a character of me&amp;hellip; who she promptly made broke, and then I guess I was then homeless. She had my avatar doing a lot of weird things. It makes me wonder what my daughter thinks of me sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just a picture of little Zoe&amp;hellip; waiting expectantly to get in the car for a car ride. She&amp;rsquo;s a good girl and deserves as many rides in the car as she can get. Maria Gasolina is her nickname&amp;hellip; she loves to burn that gas :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno&amp;hellip; not much to say about the track today. I was trying to get a hip hop/pop (hip pop?) style track going&amp;hellip; and I feel like this is where the track a day is an impediment&amp;hellip; I just need more time to work through it, but I ended up spending about half the day with my parents&amp;hellip; hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen them since before December&amp;hellip; and they only live about 40 or 50 minutes away. Just been a crazy time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from my daughter playing piano for a recital. It was&amp;hellip; three years ago now? She&amp;rsquo;s been learning to play piano for five or six years now, and knows far more about playing music than I do. She can sight read, has very good finger posture, and knows her way around the keys. On the other hand, I try and talk to her about sampling, beat making, song structure, and these are things she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do. Occasionally we will talk and bounce ideas off of each other, but she&amp;rsquo;s not into creating songs, just more interested in reproducing them right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from years ago&amp;hellip; doing an extended family vacation out in Maine&amp;hellip; Jamaica Point?!? Great area, lots of trees, water, everything you could ask for if you wanted a secluded get away. I believe the place we stayed at was originally a camp, it could sleep probably 25-40 people&amp;hellip; massive/sprawling kitchen&amp;hellip; all that fun stuff. Ended up going out on a boat a lot&amp;hellip; plenty of hikes in the woods. It was fun :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For day 27&amp;hellip; I missed the mark&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/broken-garage&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/broken-garage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not really a garage&amp;hellip; but boy was that toy for my daughter busted. I ended up upgrading it with a bunch of additions like a tiny and working tv inside, fixed up the doorbell, it was a pretty rocking little house. When we got it though, it was broken as heck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of like the song I put together. I was kind of thinking about going for a House track&amp;hellip; and as you listen to it you can tell I kind of split between an acid baseline, and some other sounds in there&amp;hellip; and never really committed to a garage track, or a UK track&amp;hellip; or anything else. It straddles the line, but not in a good way. I suspect I need to burn this track with fire&amp;hellip; but today I had been working on two or three other tracks to started out with&amp;hellip; and just never was happy with anything. I guess not every day can be decent or above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just of the moon in my backyard&amp;hellip; I was trying to test out my camera, and for the purposes of what I was trying to do, well it failed&amp;hellip; or I need to learn more options for how to setup the camera on my phone&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s probably me&amp;hellip; which should be the name for my next bad track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my daughter&amp;rsquo;s wand she had when she was in ballet as a tiny tyke. The instructors used the wands as a reward for the younger kids doing a good job and paying attention during the class, and then they could prance around with the wands. Rewards for doing what you want, is a good way to keep kids focussed, but this can work for anybody :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai MPC Live/X/One Plugin Track Velocity Test</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the above MPC Forums topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=210039&#34;&gt;BUG ON MPC 2.9? PLUGIN TRACK LEVEL EFFECTS PROGRAM LEVEL&lt;/a&gt; I created a test project to see if I could reproduce the issue below. In essence, the poster was stating that when they change the velocity setting on the track level for a plugin, that it was impacting the velocity setting for another track with the same plugin. Unfortunately this is mostly what I have for information at the time, making it difficult to either confirm or deny the problem. Below is some notes on what I attempted to test to see if I could figure out what the poster was hitting because this wasn&amp;rsquo;t behavior that I had come across before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 24&amp;hellip; down to the home stretch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from&amp;hellip; oh my&amp;hellip; two summers ago now, took a road trip out to Montana with my parents, wife, daughter, and dogs. That&amp;rsquo;s my dad&amp;rsquo;s Jeep, hooked up to the back of the RV and ready to go. That trip was an experience, but I would absolutely do it again given the chance. Was a great opportunity to spend time with the family, just veg out on the road, and see a lot of things I just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get a chance to see. Sometime I should go through the pictures and see if there is anything neat to write about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 23&amp;hellip; just a handful more to put together to wrap up the month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/foundation&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a trip to Puerto Rico&amp;hellip; probably around twenty years ago now. Just a quick snap that I took while driving by the beach. The water down there is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the track together, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d work on something a bit more experimental, so not quite so traditional drums and sounds, and just see how it came together. Overall, I am relatively happy with it, but the mixing seems off. I spent some time trying to adjust the levels, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s some EQ and filtering that would need to be done to really make the track pop. I did my best by ear, but I got stuck in a few areas where having some visuals to go with the EQ to see where harmonics are probably would have helped be a bit more precise, instead of just using a low pass and high pass filter to just remove sounds completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 22&amp;hellip; and this is a very noisy DnB track&amp;hellip; so considered yourself warned&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pictures is of a family friend&amp;rsquo;s dog, that just looked super evil for the day. I might have to play with the picture again, because it could really turn into something special. Not today though&amp;hellip; because it&amp;rsquo;s just about time to start preparing for tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is just a straight up noisy DnB track&amp;hellip; I initially wasn&amp;rsquo;t intending to get so gritty but everything just kind of fell into place that way. I had a ton more FX I had layered in, but had a bit of a hard time figuring out if you can automate turning FX on and off (turns out as far as I can tell you cannot).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 21 was not going to be a happy house track&amp;hellip; but yet&amp;hellip; bring on the bright and happy vibes&amp;hellip; I guess I could use it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painting is from when I used to record art lessons and post them online&amp;hellip; I think I did about 100 episodes, under the title &amp;ldquo;Painting in Five&amp;rdquo;. This particular one was showing how to paint out a rough sketch, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite certain it was based off of the lion from the MCM Grand. At any rate, the idea was to just show people how to quickly get some things down without thinking too much about whether it was good or bad. And now&amp;hellip; about twenty years later, I am doing a track a day just to get myself to put something down. Maybe I should bring back the &amp;ldquo;In Five&amp;rdquo; concept in the blog? I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about it, but haven&amp;rsquo;t committed to anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure how many people are NI fans&amp;hellip; I used to be deep into the ecosystem years ago&amp;hellip; but this is pretty big news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tinyurl.com/yy7uznun&#34;&gt;Native Instruments selling to Francisco Partners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the release of Machine+, and the sheer number of instruments, effects, and downloadable content for expansions, there will clearly be a lot happening at Native Instruments over the next few years. I&amp;rsquo;ll be interested to see where they continue to go with the stand alone boxes. The technology continues to deliver on more and more portable power, and there&amp;rsquo;s certainly a market for NI to capitalize on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my back yard. Well I sold my house, so technically now it is the new owner&amp;rsquo;s back yard, but I am currently still living here. Setup a lease back arrangement while I am waiting on the new place. About a month to a month and a half to go&amp;hellip; and believe me, I am ready&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s about time to get my damn music studio back together so I can get access to sounds that I want when I want them. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s been quite nice to be working with a greatly reduced set of sound sources&amp;hellip; so it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been an issue by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over at MPC Forums &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;amp;u=105910&#34;&gt;Monstre Sensible&lt;/a&gt; kicked off a thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=209558&#34;&gt;Export Song&lt;/a&gt;. A key question asked what happens to audio over the 0db mark, and if this could be considered headroom. I was ready with the &amp;ldquo;here is the manual page&amp;rdquo; to describe the behavior, but Akai didn&amp;rsquo;t actually document what happens in the manual. So&amp;hellip; time to get some scientific experiments started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response I setup a little test, using a normalized single cycle loop, and hooked it up to my Eurorack oscilloscope so I could see what was happening. In theory, this should determine if we have digital distortion in the MPC Live/X/One on the Channel Volume or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a game of air hockey with my daughter from years ago. Something we used to do a lot at the local kid casino&amp;hellip; but she is too old for that now :D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track was made using drums from MPC Tutor&amp;rsquo;s latest drum kit&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-samples.com/product.php/315/the-underground-crates/&#34;&gt;The Underground Crates&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some new drums definitely check it out. I&amp;rsquo;m digging this MPC Expansion so far, and can see it having a lot of mileage. The rest of the track is just a chopped up bass and chopped up guitar sample. Nothing too exciting&amp;hellip; and I had a vocal track with it, but it was just too much. I ended up just going for keeping this track simple and chilled out today&amp;hellip; so it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly special&amp;hellip; but I really liked how chilled out and fun it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Picture is from my dog Amy&amp;hellip; she was totally chilling the other day. Well, honestly, she chills every day! That&amp;rsquo;s her secret, she&amp;rsquo;s always relaxed. Except when the wind is blowing leaves around&amp;hellip; then she&amp;rsquo;s full attack mode. Other than that though, she&amp;rsquo;s conserving her energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you folks out there not making stuff&amp;hellip; whether it is dope or whack&amp;hellip; come on&amp;hellip; get yourself out there! I&amp;rsquo;m definitely hearing some great stuff coming from folks just trying to put things down, but there&amp;rsquo;s quite a few peeps with a lot of gear just sitting on their laurels. Get your freak on and put something together!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I will absolutely, highly, emphatically&amp;hellip; suggest checking out (i.e. purchasing) MPC Tutor&amp;rsquo;s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-samples.com/product.php/104/beat-making-on-the-mpc500/&#34;&gt;Beat Making on the MPC500&lt;/a&gt;. This will answer a ton of questions for you, and gives some great exercises to work through if you are unfamiliar with the workflow, or have questions that the MPC 500 Manual doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer. And there are a lot of things that aren&amp;rsquo;t terribly clear in Akai&amp;rsquo;s MPC 500 Manual. Plus the Bible comes with some samples, so it will help get you off the ground and running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a painting I did years ago&amp;hellip; I think I gave it to my mom? *shrug*&amp;hellip; somebody probably still has it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track came together pretty fast. I started with a pretty basic drum beat and bass line, and tweaked the FX, pitch, etc&amp;hellip; a bit to get a bit more of an interesting sound. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I added in the piano. This is just a chopped up loop, and I decided to do something different, and work on make a 32 bar playing of the chops, instead of doing my usual 4 or 8 bar play through and then working with the loops. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to consider this in the future, as it was both fun to see different ways I could utilize the sample, but I also got a few interesting places I normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is a chocolate cake we had for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day&amp;hellip; really good&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure my wife picked it up at Whole Foods&amp;hellip; if I remember correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the track it&amp;rsquo;s another mix of chops and synths&amp;hellip; and auto sampling&amp;hellip; and mistakes. I spent a lot of time looking for sounds that I felt would work together, so this track feels pretty good. Normally I&amp;rsquo;d upload the auto sampled synth&amp;hellip; but it has echo in it&amp;hellip; making me have to record every single note for the group, and then this makes it hard to use outside of a 96bpm standpoint&amp;hellip; as well&amp;hellip; it also only works for the notes I sampled which&amp;hellip; put it in the rather not so useful category for a general standpoint. I may try and find a good delay/reverb match to make it into a generic MPC patch&amp;hellip; but for now it just felt kind of strange to upload something so rigid and honestly kind of single purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture&amp;hellip; I believe is from Disney, from the animal park resort. I am pretty sure I mentioned how much my daughter loved that trip. We had a blast, and it was great to see all of the different animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is a mix of chops, and synths. I started by chopping up a break, and then moved on to finding some guitar sounds to fill out some of what I thought was going to be a lead and the bass&amp;hellip; but well&amp;hellip; the bass sound was decidedly not inspiring&amp;hellip; and I kind of drowned up the guitar sound in a lot of this track with some of the synths (whoops). So not the end of the world, and something that could be patched up with some mixing, but my intent here was to work on keeping things in key, or as in key as I could without totally knowing what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from ages ago when we took my daughter to the Friendly Farm to see some animals when she was a toddler I think&amp;hellip; the FX may make the bunny look like it is taking off&amp;hellip; but if we&amp;rsquo;re being real, it was just laying on some concrete and could not care about us. We had no food, so the meat bags weren&amp;rsquo;t of any importance to it :D. Miss the days when she was excited to spend time with me, but now that she&amp;rsquo;s a teenager, well&amp;hellip; she&amp;rsquo;s got other interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is a sunrise from the other day while I was on my way to take the dogs out for a walk. It is absolutely the best thing about this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened? Well&amp;hellip; I wanted to try to do some production on a different machine&amp;hellip; and figured I&amp;rsquo;d dig up my MPC 500. You know&amp;hellip; the one I have only goofed around with once in a while over the last few years, so pretty much forgot how to do everything on it that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I tried to slow the track down here&amp;hellip; and&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; I kind of like the sound of it, but you can tell just listening to it I drifted off into some mental space that wasn&amp;rsquo;t so focussed on the track&amp;hellip; I suspect this is what happens for creating a new track a day for a month and a half. I wanted to like it, and I wanted to feel like I was being productive, but instead I felt like I was just slamming content together. Worse, this was me just chopping loops up&amp;hellip; which normally I dig, but I think being the first day back to work, I just kind of got &amp;lsquo;meh&amp;rsquo; about it. Oh well&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s another three weeks to go of this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to pull things I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning over the last month and a half together into a more coherent type of track&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from one of my trips to the Czech Republic&amp;hellip; forget when&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a lot of stunning architecture out there, and absolutely worth checking out. About a third of the organization that I used to manage was out there, so I&amp;rsquo;d probably be out there two to three times a year to check in on everybody, see how things were going, get feedback, and make sure the the remote team members knew that I was a living and breathing human being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The image is from a trip years ago that we took our daughter to the Boston Commons and is of the paddle boat that you can take a little tour around the duck pond. Our daughter was never super excited to get on the boat, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we ever did at that age, now she&amp;rsquo;s probably too old to think it would be something fun to do. Honestly, having done the ride before myself, it&amp;rsquo;s a little pricey, and you don&amp;rsquo;t really get too much excitement out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Boy, the picture is from about four years ago&amp;hellip; Amy is looking impressively squinty&amp;hellip; might have been from the flash, I don&amp;rsquo;t really recall. Looked like a goofy enough picture to work with for today&amp;rsquo;s track though. She&amp;rsquo;s watching you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I took my own personal advice from yesterday and only applied transposes to the track level, and not the sequence level of the song. I figured that way I&amp;rsquo;m not having drums hop all over the place and can have some more control over what is going on. It was a little bit more work, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/01/08/jamuary2021-my-time-here-is-done/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2021 18:25:22 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=1654</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The track was named as such&amp;hellip; because I threw my hands up in desperation. *not* a good track, but I did learn something&amp;hellip; but first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-time-here-is-done&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-time-here-is-done&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the picture comes courtesy of the dang thing that the MPC Live did to twist up my song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f7a5f8df-cb19-42c9-b42a-304d5e1d45a1%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=1024&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, above is the drum track&amp;hellip; but let me explain how I got there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I would play around with transpose on sequence mode&amp;hellip; just do a pattern of I/IV/I/V&amp;hellip; (or no semitone offset, +4 semitone offset, no semitone offset, +5 semitone offset). With me so far? I basically just copied my main sequence twice, second sequence I put a +4 semitone transpose on the sequence, and for the third sequence I put a +5 semitone transpose on the sequence. I then went to song mode and just did the pattern Seq 1, Seq 2, Seq 3, Seq 4&amp;hellip; and then converted the whole thing back into a sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Putting this track together was fun&amp;hellip; but I did struggle a bit (again) with audio tracks, external midi, and exporting the file. I know I grumbled about this before, but Akai really needs to get an ability to mix in from the inputs for a track if/when you need to. I suppose posting everything to audio tracks is fine, but the workflow is just wonky to me. I&amp;rsquo;ll quit my belly aching on it, but it did lead to a bit of a mess uploading a track that was missing a core synth part. On the pro soundcloud account it&amp;rsquo;s not a *huge* problem to replace a track, but boy was it funny to go back and listen to the track and notice it was missing. It&amp;rsquo;s something I can fix in my on process for creating and publishing songs, but&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a hassle. Also&amp;hellip; to be fair, even if there was a checkbox to use external gear to get it in from the inputs I&amp;rsquo;d probably still complain about it being a problem because then I&amp;rsquo;d probably double up sounds, or cause myself other problems. Maybe it is fine Akai? Maybe! This is just something that&amp;rsquo;s been such an ingrained workflow in DAWs though, that it does lead me to at least one area where the MPC in standalone isn&amp;rsquo;t quite enough as a DAW. Everything inside the box it is cool, but exporting out content it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work quite so hot. /grumbling off&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from some resin structures we made as a family this year. My dad was all about how copper killed COVID or something silly, so he sent us some. I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy into it, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think he did either, but we ended up all doing remote family molds to just try and make something interesting. I had never poured resin like this before, so it was interesting at least to see the process up close and personal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from a Barnum and Bailey Circus show that we brought our daughter to. She loved it. Definitely was weird though&amp;hellip; we were near the front of the stadium and these massive and majestic creatures still looked so small. We offered our daughter to go see them up close after the show, but I think she was three at the time and was terrified to get anywhere near them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I rolled this track together in what&amp;hellip; less than an hour I think? I just did lazy/manual chops by playing the track and tapping out the pads&amp;hellip; I know it&amp;rsquo;s a bit sloppy, but honestly it sounded fine, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking to make a masterpiece. From there I knocked out a bit of drums to just have something to flip to, and was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from a trip to Disney World that my wife and I took our daughter to for her third birthday. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember the trip at all today, but at the time she had a blast. When she was younger she was quite a clingy kid, and I can still remember how sore my shoulders were because she refused to walk anywhere and instead wanted to ride on my shoulders for the entire trip. Do not recommend&amp;hellip; the shoulder part&amp;hellip; the Disney trip was great :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I mentioned yesterday that I started working on this track yesterday right after throwing in the towel for day two, and I really dig how this track came out. I decided to keep the flow super short, so it is just a Main section, Drop section, and Outro section&amp;hellip; so absolutely nothing fancy, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it needed much else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my daughter finding a frog in the backyard over the summer and we caught a few pictures of it. She was super excited to have found such a small critter hanging out in the back yard and just wanted to get a few close ups of the little guy (or gal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fiddled with this track a bit throughout the day and it never quite came together the way I wanted. I tried to play everything out by hand as much as possible, and well&amp;hellip; I find it okay. The transitions between sections are particularly week again, and I know I could have done better to build up more energy if I had just had the time. Instead I decided to cut my losses on this track and move forward to preparing for day three instead&amp;hellip; which meant this track suffered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;First off, the picture is of my oldest dog, Amy (pronounced Emmy). I was trying to find a picture that might feel a little dreamy, where you might not quite know what was going on, was maybe a little shocking, but not really in the terrifying space. This was a picture from taking Amy home from being spayed, and we had to put the cone on her head to keep her from licking the wound. She is by no means intimidating, and is actually one of the sweetest dogs you could find, but this picture does make her look a little haunted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I just wrapped up putting together a track a day, no matter how good or bad, and posting *something* daily over the month of December. My goal was to do all of the production on the MPC Live mk2, and just push content to a coherent enough thought or conclusion without necessarily worrying about all of the bells and whistles. Sampling sources, expansion packs, completing old incomplete tracks, that was all on the table for me throughout December.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ninth-circle&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ninth-circle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track came about from creating an audio track from a 32 bar loop on the Access Virus TI2 Darkstar. I automated a few parameters and figured it sound cool enough to add some drums and FX to it. I wanted to try and get something slower and more droning this time around, instead of some of the faster and more manic tracks I have been laying down the last month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So this track has several key groups that I auto sampled off of both my Access Virus TI2 Darkstar and Waldorf Iridium. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d upload the patches for those interested or who are just looking for some synth sounds to play with&amp;hellip; so you can get them below. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother trimming anything&amp;hellip; so the file is a bit large&amp;hellip; but go nuts and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Picture comes courtesy of a sunset in Aruba from a couple years back. Took the family to go see the island, and we all had a blast. Heck even got my wife into the ocean for a little bit, despite her being completely afraid to hop into water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the notes I played around with Orb Composer a bit in order to come up with note progressions for Arp/Bass/Chord/Melody&amp;hellip; The key is Ab, Major scale with a chord progression of i-iv-vii-II, or Abmb7/Eb, Dbm/Ab, Gbmb7, and Bbb/Fb. I tried to use the MPC Live Performance Pads to operate in the correct scale&amp;hellip; maybe it worked? I didn&amp;rsquo;t play out too much live so it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly like it probably mattered much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie to you folks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a lot of back to back to back tracks for me, and I am kind of looking forward to the month ending so I can get into a different musical head space. This was just a straight up Expansion Pack kit that I loaded up, and then added a bit more to it with some samples from my brand spanking new Waldorf Iridium. I was more into just playing with the Iridium than making a track, but figured I needed to get moving and actually put something together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The intent for this track was to put some content together in Reason and then make some create patterns that changed chord structures throughout the song. Started off good, made a bunch of chords, arpeggios, and bass lines to flow in a Bb Minor&amp;hellip; chord progression of I-VII-v-ii&amp;hellip; resulting in Bbmb7, AbM7, Fm/Ab, Cmb7&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was struggling to pull anything together for day 26. I started a bunch of tracks but nothing really grabbed me. Must be a downer from all the excitement from Christmas. *shrug*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/a-grave-decision&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/a-grave-decision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was just pulling things together randomly&amp;hellip; and then when I&amp;rsquo;d start to track out different sections nothing felt like it felt like it worked together. Heck, I removed half of this track because it just didn&amp;rsquo;t sit in place correctly and the transitions were quite jarring. It is possible that I am just getting tired of making a track a day, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s just the mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MPCBB 268 - Relaxing Action</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t any other entries, so I figured what the heck and put together a track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample itself was pretty basic, so I figured I would work on chopping it up and just finding a drum kit to play to it. I wanted to focus as much as possible on keeping the original audio track playing throughout the track without it sounding too repetitive, this meant making variations to work through, and seeing what worked. Ultimately I wanted some of the shorter chops to play longer through this process, so a quick detune of 6 semitones had me pretty well sorted so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any gaps of silence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My track for Christmas&amp;hellip; woo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/saturday-night-jive&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/saturday-night-jive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another track that I tried to go for a more minimal sound, and it was made up of only three loops. I know the track itself is not very complex or technical, but I worked on making up for it by making a few variations of each loop to get some variety in the flips. Given that I am still doing a new track a day, and time has been at a premium, this gave me a bit more time to be picky on the loops that I chose to work with in order to put the track together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas Eve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/east-coast-comfort-food&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/east-coast-comfort-food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this track together from just three samples&amp;hellip; a drum break&amp;hellip; an acoustic bass&amp;hellip; and a piano melody. Nothing too fancy, but I wanted to spend the time today making different patterns from the different samples and then mixing it up and seeing how it came together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly stoked by the track itself, but it does feel like it is worth taking the time to make a few change ups this way, even if I&amp;rsquo;m limited to doing a track a day. Honestly, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much more work, and I think where the results worked&amp;hellip; well they did work out well. It&amp;rsquo;s just that I need to make the time to do it. Normally for these daily tracks I have been trying to just get one 4 or 8 bar chunk sounding &amp;ldquo;just right&amp;rdquo;, but then I end up trying to make it sound interesting by dropping sections, building, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well this one was a bit more of a pain to get started. I have had a mild headache most of the day and just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to put any energy into making a track&amp;hellip; however the show must go on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is courtesy of my basement&amp;hellip; and the dead spider is courtesy of the glass apparently trapping it in. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what made me think of the picture or the title for the track, but somehow they are now linked in my brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of a trip to Munich. Not so much a tourist type of city, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to see there. I think that particular shot came from a train ride that I took with my family to go check out the Olympic Stadium out there. It was interesting to see, but kind of sad at the same time to see something that had so much funding and investment put into it that ended up not being kept up and maintained as much as you&amp;rsquo;d hope. I suspect that a lot of the Olympic areas around the world are like this, and I suppose when things get back to normal I will have to travel around to check out more for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from my trip to Athens Greece with some filters on it. Nothing fancy, but the statue was incredible to see in person. It&amp;rsquo;s made out of plexiglass or glass and stacked up to look like a person. We walked by the statue quite a bit for our family trip, and would definitely go there again!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today I went back to the now &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; standard of making some loops in Reason Studio, working on some sound design to get some interesting sounds, and then bouncing the loops out to be chopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things I tried to switch it up. First, I made four bar loops, but extended them out to eight bars, because I wanted the ambience to flow through to the start of the first bar, instead of hearing the loop in the first bar kind of catch up. Something sounds a bit off&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s possible that I have an LFO that is not sync&amp;rsquo;d to the track, or maybe my copy/paste of notes was bad. I tried it&amp;hellip; and while it didn&amp;rsquo;t work quite how I wanted, well&amp;hellip; it still produced results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth day is upon me&amp;hellip; and I called &amp;ldquo;Sudden Death&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-death&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is in fact no death, but I named it as such because I really don&amp;rsquo;t have much time left for the rest of the day, and had to pull something together in about 30 minutes. So instead of doing sound design in reason, today I just loaded up a pre-made drum kit&amp;hellip; from &amp;lsquo;LoFi Soul and Future Beats&amp;rsquo; and just went to town to knock it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track&amp;hellip; I am still making loops in Reason Studio and looping them&amp;hellip; this might be the last one for the month&amp;hellip; not because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the results, but just so I can experiment with some other track making techniques&amp;hellip; or who knows&amp;hellip; go back to finishing off some older tracks. The next few days we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I just like this track&amp;hellip; guess I have nothing else to say about it today :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; I was being lazy yesterday&amp;hellip; cleaning up after the blizzard kind of got to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this track I really decided to pair down the frantic energy and focus a bit more on natural sounding instruments with some air, space, and environment to them. As I said yesterday, I am quite happy about how it came out, though mixing was a bit of a pain due to how different the levels were on all of the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my wife&amp;rsquo;s hand while we were visiting in Bangalore last year and she asked to get some Henna artwork done on her hand. Had a great time out there and would love to go back. The food was incredible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, probably approaching the last days during this month of pulling content off of Reason Studio daily and then chopping up loops for inspiration, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking around for another sound source or two for the month just to push myself in other directions. I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to do some sound recording, and who knows, maybe I go industrial?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am still having a blast making loops in Reason and exporting it out to the MPC for chopping up. This track had a lot going on with it, and I had fun making the initial four bars&amp;hellip; but once I got started tracking it out into a song things really went sideways. The transitions just didn&amp;rsquo;t work and the track started to fall apart. I think it was more a case of a few different sounds just not supporting each other very well and while I was having fun making the four bar loop it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, but when trying to put transitions together it became a bit jarring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track needed some mixing love, I tried to nail it, but I still think the saw synth is a bit intense. Perhaps this is what the track needed? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. After this many tracks can I really be sure of anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am sure that all of the content was yet again produced in Reason Studio, and I ran it through the Yorgos Arabatzsis Mastering. I&amp;rsquo;m getting a bit more of a handle with both making loops in Reason Studio 11, and working with YAM to get the sounds I am looking for, and pushing the sounds I don&amp;rsquo;t like back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is another track that I spent some time putting together four bar loops in Reason Studio 11 in order to get some content that I could chop up and mangle in the MPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything too special about the chops, but the bass line was played out a bit wonky to start, and I just kind of went with it. The first two bars are super simple, and then the last two bars get a lot more complex. From there, I built a lot of the melody and chords around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track was a ton of fun to put together. I wanted to change my perspective on making tracks this month, and decided to focus on chopping up samples, but 100% making my own content. So this project started as a deep dive into Reason Studio 11 to really really really get into some sound design. I knew I wanted to go glitchy and spacey, and I think I pretty well delivered on those themes in this track. So all drum patterns, loops, everything were initially created in a 30 minute session in Reason, and then I bounced and exported six tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another attempt at just using the built in instruments on the Akai MPC Live&amp;hellip; and yeah&amp;hellip; I guess as an easy listening track it is okay? Not much to say today&amp;hellip; I think making all of these tracks back to back is slowly driving me to madness. The last two days have felt like pretty hard flops for what I am trying to do, but seriously, this is how you learn. I will keep pushing ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was digging through some more old tracks I had put together, and wanted to wrap this up. I sampled off the piano through CBA Generation Loss a year ago, and just really dug the sound of it. When I stumbled upon the track I just kept thinking, you know&amp;hellip; I need to make something of this..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, I am not really happy with how it all came together. I think I tried too hard, and it&amp;rsquo;s kind of hot garbage. I definitely spent too much time working on it and just not feeling the vibe I had been hoping to go for, and ultimately it just didn&amp;rsquo;t really come together into something that I can smile at. Even just going back and listening to it again I have to give it a thumbs down. Not my best work, but we&amp;rsquo;ve all got to start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track was put together using only the plugins and fx available from the MPC Live in standalone mode, so no samples, loops, or any other audio content. I wanted to see what I could put together using the new drum machine, electric, tube, and bass plugins to put something together. A few of the tracks I really drizzled on the delay and feedback, and I tossed a gated filter for good measure. So, today was the creation of a totally new beat out of the box, and just seeing where it would take me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well I am certainly embarrassed. Instead of going through &amp;ldquo;weeks old&amp;rdquo; tracks, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d dig deep and see what gems might be out there that are a year or more old&amp;hellip; and I found this little number. Out of the box it was nearly ready to go, and for the life of me I could not tell you why I never got around to just putting a bow on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of my house when I first bought it. My daughter used to call it potato brown. My wife and I have done so much work on this place over the years, and are in the process of moving into another house. I&amp;rsquo;ll miss this house, but it was my first house, and it&amp;rsquo;ll hold a special place for me and my family!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to day numero six. I started this little number about two weeks ago&amp;hellip; just before I wanted to try and put out a track a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/powerful-feeling&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/powerful-feeling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is&amp;hellip; probably eight years old now? There were some monks making mandalas in my home town and I have some interesting videos of the work they did. The level of concentration is impressive to put together these images, and you can see they are using masks to make sure the do not disturb the sand while they are making the picture. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool process, and it was fun to watch. My daughter got a kick out of it, and I have a video where one of the monks helped her make her own tiny image out of sand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The painting is a water color that I did years ago&amp;hellip; probably over fifteen years ago. I happened to find it while going through my old notebooks looking for some blank paper. It&amp;rsquo;s not that great, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the other side to do some paintings for a project I am working on with my sister. So long sort of interesting tree and wild&amp;hellip; what is that&amp;hellip; a sunset?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I did some prep last night chopping and getting some drum tracks down, but this is an entirely new track, so nothing pulled from the old archives of unfinished tracks past. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure how much time I&amp;rsquo;d have today. This lead into some discovery of just loading up loops, chopping them and seeing what I could throw against the wall to stick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get more consistent about putting tracks together, finding stuff I thought had been lost for various reasons, and just cleaning up my mess of files stored all over the place. I still have a bit of a mess, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit better organized at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This album is all tracks done this year, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a blast just playing around with new instruments, old instruments, and overall just making more time to make music for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This started as a four bar loop about two or three weeks ago on my Akai MPC Live mk2, and I just left the main loop running for like an hour and didn&amp;rsquo;t get sick of it. The drums were all on the same track and I did need to separate those out, but beyond that I had a good enough mind to keep the bass, wurli, and sitar sounds on their own tracks, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overwhelming to dig in and actually start making different sections of the song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track was something I had just made a two bar section&amp;hellip; and really liked it a month or so back, but just didn&amp;rsquo;t really know where to go with it. In order to complete my track a day I figured it is completely fine to dig up old material and put it together. This is another track done entirely on the Akai MPC mk2, and this time no fun mastering. It&amp;rsquo;s mixed closer to the way I wanted it, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel it needed any oomph to the track, though I say that and have re-listened to it a few times and kind of question my decision. It might&amp;rsquo;ve benefited from another round of processing, but hey gotta keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just a lofi track to relax to. Yeah I know it&amp;rsquo;s kind of noisy&amp;hellip; as the lofi folks like? A lot of vinyl, tape, and other random clicks and clacks. All done on the MPC Live mk2. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably keep all of the tracks done through the MPC Live mk2 this month just to really dig into it a bit more and see if 2.9 has either weird workflow bugs I trip over or things that get me to think about working on the tracks differently inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MPC Programs - NT S950 Volume 4</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/11/30/mpc-programs-nt-s950-volume-4/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got some more S950 programs sampled, but first, here&amp;rsquo;s the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v4.zip&#34;&gt;NT - S950 v4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v4.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing I learned this time around was that from the Sampler menu, if you select a mono source and set the sampling to mono&amp;hellip; well I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to use Fission to covert the samples to mono. That saved some headaches for sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall notes for the auto sampling:&lt;br&gt;
\* 430 Mono samples&lt;br&gt;
\* Should play from C-2 to G8&lt;br&gt;
\* Sampled C0 to C5 in most cases, with a stride of 4&lt;br&gt;
\* Generally 16 samples per program&lt;br&gt;
\* Only one Sample Layer at velocity of 127&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A conversation started on MPC Forums about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;amp;t=206423&#34;&gt;MPC &amp;amp; S900/950 Routing Question&lt;/a&gt;. We got into details about how the S900/S950 worked, which then lead into S900/S950 samples sounding more full on the S1000 and later. I ended up taking a stab at sampling both white noise and a drum break on the S950 with a bandwidth of 3000 and 19200, and then playing the notes across the key group to get some samples together. Below is the project and recordings from the S950 and S1000 for your own listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back at it for another round of sampling off of my trusty Akai S950&amp;hellip; still working like a champ. Before getting into the details, here&amp;rsquo;s the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v3-1.zip&#34;&gt;NT - S950 v3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v3-1.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is that I am getting faster at sampling, but the bad news is that I made a mistake on a few of the programs and called them S95 instead of S950. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t too big of a deal since the .xpm files are text editable since they are in a human readable format, but it was a bit of a chore to rename all of the samples, edit the file to do a search and replace of S95 to S950, and then hope everything worked out okay. Still, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad, and I have gotten some more samples together for your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent some more time last night recording off of the Akai S950&amp;hellip; and I can tell you I continue to really dig the low end sound. Before digging in a bit, here is the link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v2.zip&#34;&gt;NT - S950 v2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v2.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to a few days ago, this is MPC X/Live/One formatted for the program file, but the samples are 44.1k/16-bit mono, so you can load them into most MPCs and samplers. I was definitely a bit faster at flying through the low end key group and setting it to record notes down to C0, though I still forgot to check and change C5&amp;hellip; in about half the cases this resulted in one less sample for the program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track came together last night from just patching and trying to see what I could do after not really messing with Eurorack for a few weeks. My wife and I have been ramping up to keep the house cleaned for showings, and it was just something that I haven&amp;rsquo;t given myself time to do. Plus, having a mess of wires hanging out all over the place probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t the best thing for pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent about six hours yesterday recording off samples from my Akai S950, and auto sampling them into my MPC Live mk2. Near the end I think I was starting to get cross eyed. Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I have posted the samples below, and then will get into the details after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v1.zip&#34;&gt;NT - S950 v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v1.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is MPC X/Live/One formatted&amp;hellip; though the samples are 44.1k/16-bit mono, so should load into plenty of samplers. I considered converting this stack into a MPC Expansion, but gave up on the app for now. Maybe later, when I figure out the steps to create previews&amp;hellip; and apparently it wants sequences for each program *shrug*. I watched a few videos on YouTube, and read Tutor&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-tutor.com/mpc-expansion-packs-complete-guide/&#34;&gt;Complete Guide to MPC Expansion Packs&lt;/a&gt; but got the impression that you might need to use the MPC Software in order to do some of these things more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track I threw together for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=204552&#34;&gt;MPC Forums Beat Battle #293&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s still open if you wanted to check it out and post up your own take. The sample to flip this time around is Brenton Wood &amp;ldquo;Trouble&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just loaded the track into the MPC Live, set it to chop on transients with a setting of 50, and then just started looking for samples I thought sounded cool. Was this lazy? Probably, but for this beat battle I wanted to force myself outside of the mindset of using perfect loops, and some of those transients were janky as heck, making me think way outside of the box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to do something kind of epic, kind of 8-bit, and kind of fun&amp;hellip; hopefully this track hits those beats for you. All of the tracks were done on the MPC Live mk2, and I exported the stems for arrangement out in Ableton Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most abusive thing I did was decimating that clap hit into a bit crunched bunch of noise, the rest was pretty standard flare, with maybe a bit of automation thrown in for effect just to give the track some movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I put this track together last week for the MPC BB 292, and then forgot to post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first trick, to get the really over cooked sound from the track, I ended up pitching the track up 3 octaves before playing it, and then sampled it into my Akai S950. This really stripped away a lot of the high end information, but also made the low end quite a bit punchier to my ears. Initially I pitched it up so much because I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the sample time to record a nearly 6 minute song into the roughly 23 seconds of sample time&amp;hellip; and pitching the content up so extremely really let me squeeze it all in there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah I did it&amp;hellip; I boxed up a bunch of music gear. I just needed to get some more focus on the gear I want to use right now, and figure out how to make it a bit simpler. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the final form, but gosh I have a sit and stand desk, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to use it because the short rack didn&amp;rsquo;t have long enough cables to move out from under the desk, so it was permanently stuck high.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Just in case, I also bought a replacement display&amp;hellip; so that I could replace that in the event that something went horribly wrong. Stay tuned to learn that yes&amp;hellip; something did go horribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well over at the MPC Forums a user created a topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=204251&#34;&gt;Tidy Keygroup Names&lt;/a&gt; and thought that there was a bug when they were auto sampling, as it was putting f/p/fm/pm into the names of the samples instead of actual velocity. I chuckled to myself, because this seems kind of strange to show up into sample names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this strange you may ask? Well, for starters the auto sampler uses both the note names, as well as the midi note numbers in the file name when you auto sample an instrument. This makes sense, even if it is duplicate information. However, when you do multiple velocity levels, the auto sampler adds f/fm/pm/p (or a subset there of) into the file names. Strange huh? Especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all love adding new instruments, effects, processors, computers, mixers, samplers, recorders, display cases, and cables (well really, cables?), but we should all take the time to ask ourselves if we really need more gear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As musicians, part of the fun in being creative is getting a new tool to express ourselves. There are companies putting out fun and cool new toys competing for our dollar, and it makes it super easy to end up spending a lot of money on gear that you don&amp;rsquo;t need, doesn&amp;rsquo;t inspire you, or just ends up consuming your time and taking you away from being productive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I just picked up the Cooper FX: Arcade&amp;hellip; and have been putting several of the cards through their paces to see what kinds of sounds I can get out of them. So far, enjoying the tape effects, lofi effects, and getting some quite interesting distortion. Definitely feels like a pedal I can take on the road with me without needing to lug around a huge pedal board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hook it up, I have really just setup output 3 on the Live routed into the Arcade input, and the output of the Arcade is going back into the Live&amp;rsquo;s In one. Honestly, nothing too fancy yet, heck I haven&amp;rsquo;t even tried to use CC or midi between the two devices yet to control the FX parameters, but that&amp;rsquo;ll be coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another STBB track! We had three tracks to work with this week, and I pulled a little something from all of the tracks. I mostly focussed on trying to sculpt the sounds with some filter to give everything a bit of room. The only sample I pulled from externally was a drum loop that I chopped up to give the drums a bit more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely spent more time on this track than I meant to, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t come out as great as I had hoped, but it still sounds kind of fun. Probably got to get back to vocals in STBB tracks if I want to have a chance at competing over there though :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recorded off some of the sounds that I used on the OP-1 as key groups into the MPC Live mk2. They are not going to sound exactly the same, but it should be pretty close. Definitely go into the key group and change the release to taste, as I pretty much left them as defaults, so it&amp;rsquo;ll be a pretty abrupt end of the samples as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this track together for MPC Forums BB #290. It was a quick flip on the MPC Live mk2&amp;hellip; and although I did a lot of chopping, I literally just went with the loop that I pulled and then just dropped percussion all around it. There isn&amp;rsquo;t too much to say about this because it just went fast. Sometimes the simplest flips work best :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=201048&amp;amp;start=75&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt; Danoc was asking a bit about the OP-1&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s my response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the Teenage Engineering OP-1. It has taken on the status of being an overpriced (released in 2011’ish at about $799 USD, today sells new for $1299 USD which was the latest price hike in 2019) piece of hipster music production hardware. It’s an interesting piece of gear, but isn’t exactly user friendly&amp;hellip; if you want to push yourself to think outside of the box, it has that in spades, but for me it is not a serious piece of music gear in today’s space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my third pass at a Synth Pop track. I did some cool stuff on the MPC Live, but it is definitively not Synth Pop. Something I will absolutely put together as a finished track, but both tracks strayed from the Synth Pop sound way too much, and I decided I&amp;rsquo;d give it one more try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I just got kind of into the dark vibe of the sounds after pitching things down. I suspect the vocals are take it or leave it&amp;hellip; and I definitely could have cleaned them up a bit. I guess it could come across as some mumbling or something, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t my intent. I also think the clickers are a bit too loud and probably could have used some filtering. Ah well&amp;hellip; this was another quick one to pull together. It feels looser because of it, but there is something for me here to just keep knocking these things out quickly instead of getting so stuck in my head making the tracks, especially for BBs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track&amp;hellip; well the rule was to use the sample&amp;hellip; and do something outside your comfort zone. I rarely put any kind of silence in my track, so I wanted to force myself to have breaks throughout the song, but have it sound as natural as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the track was put together on the MPC Live mk2, but I also did load the finished track into Ableton Live for some further poking and prodding. The middle section that kind of functions as a drop, and the outro were both done in Ableton. I figured it was a short enough track, but needed something to mix it up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A bit of a scramble this one&amp;hellip; but had fun listening to the song and picking out the parts I liked. All done on the MPC Live mk2&amp;hellip; only software intervention was to load Fission so I could just cut the track to length and do a quick fade out. I promise :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around I tried to create 3 different main sections, and then worked through drops, buildups and such to get the track together. Then just strung them together in song mode. It was a bit of a hassle because I exploded a few too many tracks in spots, and then from section to section they didn&amp;rsquo;t line up&amp;hellip; add to this that I did not name any of the tracks properly, and it made for a bit more confusion trying to create various sections. Worked out pretty quickly though, I&amp;rsquo;d say this track came together in two hours max.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Just happened to see this when logging into the Propellerheads site and stumbled upon the shop to see that the Waves H-Comp plugin is currently free at  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/&#34;&gt;https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/&lt;/a&gt; on sale for $49 through August 30th&amp;hellip; and with promo code FREECOMP it is free. Just grabbed it yesterday. I still need to install it and check it out, but hard to pass up a free plugin, especially when it is usually going for $200.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track comes courtesy of my Eurorack build. I am working on trying to clean up content I have recorded on the 4MS WAV RECORDER, and found this. It was reasonably complete enough that I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just post it up as is. There isn&amp;rsquo;t anything too fancy going on, but it was fun to put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a finished project, and was something I was more interested in playing around with some ideas for a live performance. It was really just pulling together a bass line, some drums, and a freaked out probably over processed evolving space sound. From there I just used some basic mixing components to evolve some of the sounds by turning knobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track has been a bit of a labor of love&amp;hellip; haha. I decided to jump into the next challenge for Electro Funk, and was listening to a lot of tracks from the era. If you want to check out the main post on MPC Forums for the Electro Funk Challenge, well go on over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=200241&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the Electric Funk Challenge over on the MPC Forums I ended up with a bunch of extra key groups and a drum kit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up using. Well I used it for the original track that I put together, but nothing made it onto the finished track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the in progress track, that just got too muddy, and I lost the project files and haven&amp;rsquo;t felt like recreating this thing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to check out the MPC Forums Challenge&amp;hellip; this time we&amp;rsquo;re working on some Electro Funk &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=200241&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a break from some of the Beat Battles to work on some songs&amp;hellip; and so far this is fun, and a good opportunity to dust off gear other than the sampler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my notes so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of samples is really sparse, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;d think of sampling today.  I do get a vibe of a much smaller sample set, where used, in the genre.  I&amp;rsquo;m hearing some similar sounds here and there&amp;hellip; some fx hits or stabs&amp;hellip; which I&amp;rsquo;m not totally sure if these are off of a sample record, or just from a drum machine&amp;hellip; but for me it really indicates that there really isn&amp;rsquo;t any complex sampling, pitch shifting, etc&amp;hellip; and these are going to sound inauthentic in this genre.  So for me, I&amp;rsquo;m likely going to avoid straight up sample tricks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh before I forget… here&amp;rsquo;s a few key groups that I made, and I did say I would share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nt-bells.zip&#34;&gt;NT - Bells&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/nt-bells.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bells are sampled across a few octaves, but not tuned. Should just requires tuning the master, but I did not end up using them and got lazy. Since I am posting it for free, if you cannot do anything with it, well that&amp;rsquo;s on you! For those interested, this is sampled from Eurorack, in particular Elements is doing the heavy lifting, with some very minor FX on it to taste.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ll kick off first and foremost, this entire track was done on the MPC Live mk2.  Not for any particular reason, but I started there, and just kept going.  Being able to unplug the device while taking my daughter out to ballet, horseback riding, waiting for my wife to finish shopping… whatever it was, was certainly helpful.  Besides auto sampling a few synths, everything was done in the box including fx, mixing, mastering, all that.  I know a lot of folks know it is possible, but for those who doubt it, maybe this changes your mind?  I actually expected a few times to want to be reaching for Ableton, Reason, or Melodyne to do a few things, but that was frequently when I was away from my computer and I just pushed my way through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first MPC was the Akai MPC 1k Black. I really cut my teeth on this MPC over the years, and with JJOS it really made the MPC 1k shine. Life was pretty simple, but it had been given an amazing workflow for chopping, sampling, and writing music. I bought it back when the black model was released, and held on to it until just this year. Watching the prices of a lot of the old gear I had sky rocket, it was hard to justify keeping it around, especially since it was living mostly in it&amp;rsquo;s old box. As I&amp;rsquo;ve written about before, I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep old gear around for the sake of keeping it, and it was just time to part with the MPC 1k along with a lot of the other gear that has gone out the door, hopefully on to better homes that will appreciate and use the gear to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track is done from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=734&#34;&gt;STBB Forever #699&lt;/a&gt; Beat Battle. I used the tracks provided, as well as a track that I did years ago to jam these tracks together. It is not a great track, and more just playing around. The rules were to use the provided samples, a beep, vocal or bleep track or whatever, and you could use outside sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I had the idea to do a beat and then transition into a DnB/Jungle type of track&amp;hellip; but I did it. Results were not so great though. It leaves for an awkward transition, and the second half only really hits the rules because I had a computerized vocal &amp;ldquo;beep&amp;rdquo; sound in it. So, uhm&amp;hellip; I guess points for &amp;ldquo;creativity&amp;rdquo; maybe? But for actual execution this is kind of hot garbage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I won last week&amp;rsquo;s Beat Battle and got to pick the rules and the sample. The sample I went for is Miles Davis - So What.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules I went for were any external sounds allowed, but you have to sample whatever you want to add from a microphone. No mic simulations allowed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first patch I put together on the new build out of my Eurorack. Just a short video messing around with the patch&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said in the previous post, this track had to come together quite quickly&amp;hellip; and this is maybe at best an hour worth of work. I scrambled to get it together and then added some decorative vocals and a baseline to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness this track is a bit over compressed, you can hear it especially when the hi hats slam into the available headroom. I guess I got too carried away with everything in the short amount of time&amp;hellip; but I got what I got :D.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty then! So for this track, I started it and finished it in about 30 minutes. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to hit the deadline yesterday&amp;hellip; and figured I&amp;rsquo;d just cut to the chase for the throw down. To pull this together I just grabbed a four bar section that I liked the sound of, chopped it, pitched it down, and then got to business laying out a track. I then searched through drums and kits to piece together something for drums, a little fx, and some bass that was halfway decent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first track I put together using my new euro rack modular setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/endless-space&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/endless-space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to remember this patch&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll post a picture and kind of describe it as best as I can. It was more a test to see how cable routing goes, and if I need longer cables. Turns out so far it isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, and there&amp;rsquo;s a little something for everybody in every corner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Erik and sent him this picture so he knew I had the case in hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3b1989f0-f4b8-439f-9186-2a59c4b9548f%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to strong arm the case up to my desk, and upon turning it on I can tell you the noise from the power was very very high! I was concerned that it was a dirty power supply, but figured that once I had racked everything the sound might go down&amp;hellip; sometimes power supplies make a lot of noise when they don&amp;rsquo;t have a load on them, or too much of a load. You never know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I got the notice from UPS that the case was on it&amp;rsquo;s way, and it will be here today! Super excited to get my hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few pictures of the package and opening up the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3b1989f0-f4b8-439f-9186-2a59c4b9548f%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UPS delivery person said this was one of the best packaged shipments he has ever seen, and I have to agree. We flipped it (shhhh&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t tell Erik Needham). This is a beefy case, and I have to say, it looks like some pretty good quality wood for the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s challenge on &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=711&#34;&gt;STBB Forever is #697 - Claude Debussy&lt;/a&gt;. Rules were pretty open, go find your own Claude sounds. I ended up listening to a *lot* of this Youtube track&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to the whole thing, but I did consume a lot of it. There is a lot of great music in here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well this was a super quick flip of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=199354&amp;amp;p=1800618#p1800618&#34;&gt;MPC Forums BB #284&lt;/a&gt;, and when I say quick I mean I did this in about 30 minutes. This was entirely an exercise to force myself to get it completed, since I am kind of running out of time, and I wanted to see where I could go if I just unrealistically restricted myself. My primary goal was to make sure that I wanted to limit the number of takes I did to put this together, and figure out how to glue it together in a way that it would sound coherent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Chest Pain</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/07/10/track-chest-pain/</link>

&lt;p&gt;This track came together pretty quickly. Maybe two hours of goofing around on the MPC Live mk2 at most. The core of it started with me patching on my modular system, and seeing what tones I could create, and then sync&amp;rsquo;ing that to the MPC Live mk2 over CV&amp;hellip; well technically gate signals. You can see from the picture that this is honestly not a terribly complicated patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8bad7823-6b1f-479f-b535-ad0aeb3ee990%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=883&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch is what is making that sometimes bass, sometimes bloopy sound in the track. Effectively Tempi is being clocked by the MPC Live mk2 gate out, which is then clocking the Wogglebug, Brains, and a strike on the RxMx. DPO is doing the oscillator duties today, and being run into the FxDF 6db slope that is then patched into RxMx. In turn, RxMx is being filtered by the QPAS which is then going to the output. Of note, Pressure Points/Brains is being used to modulate the 1v/octave to generate the change in tones, as well as the left !! on QPAS, and the Wogglebug step modulation is driving the QPAS filter changes. I went this way to create a fair mix of &amp;ldquo;in control&amp;rdquo; and somewhat random modulation, which I recorded in as an eight bar loop in the MPC Live mk2 Looper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a track I have been working on for about a week on the PO-33. All the sampling and mixing was done within the little box. I continue to like this little device because it really forces you to think about a potentially crippling amount of sampling time and a very real four note polyphony limit. Some of the previous tracks I have done really ran into the polyphony wall, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly drop notes the way I would expect at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The initial repair has shown that the previously busted up Akai MPC 500 has in fact been noisy mostly from the obliterated Volume and Q-Link board. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to use it for a few days, but the next problem that has surfaced has been that some of the tact switches have been a bit finicky, and require multiple presses to get them to register a press on occasion. This is super annoying, and definitely slows down your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ordered a case from Erik Needham back in January. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting patiently for six months or so now I think. It&amp;rsquo;s been a balance of waiting to get the modules together I wanted, and trying to get more room by selling off gear I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use any more. If you want to check him out go to his Instagram &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/needhamwoodworks/&#34;&gt;Needham Woodworks&lt;/a&gt; or look him up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=Needham%20woodworks&#34;&gt;Reverb&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely some great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this week, the drop was what&amp;hellip; 300+ clips. The rules were to use at least three, and you had to put product placement in your track of at least five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;rsquo;t used Ableton Live a whole lot in the last few years, but I still mostly know my way around, and it&amp;rsquo;s like riding a bicycle right, just hop back on?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just (hopefully) wrapped up the audio processing for my sister&amp;rsquo;s book. Since the last post, I probably could have done three other posts about the series of events that happened. Suffice it to say that there are some competing formats, tools, and audiobook sites that aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly in alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I had gotten my sister&amp;rsquo;s book all processed, converted to .mp3 format, and she was quite happy with the sound. Unfortunately she doesn&amp;rsquo;t really understand audio processing or audio file formats, so this kicked off a chain of unfortunate re-exports. Each process and export job probably took me 60-90 minutes&amp;hellip; and since I had only ever expected to do this twice, I never automated the job. Each time I ended up processing the files, it was &amp;ldquo;just one more change&amp;rdquo; which had me shrug, and go off and do a whole bunch of clicking to re-process the files again. After time five, you&amp;rsquo;d think I would have learned my lesson. Which I did, but maybe not the one you&amp;rsquo;d think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai MPC 500 Repair</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=644</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a few days back I posted about picking up an &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/block-editor/post/neartao.wordpress.com/620&#34;&gt;Akai MPC 500 on Reverb&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; and it was absolutely a mess inside. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t see it, I&amp;rsquo;ll post a picture below, but it was all jacked up. I suspect something heavy was dropped on it, or some other excessive amount of force. Maybe you can help decide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/99d1f477-1d68-410d-afad-a60e004da54c%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it was busted enough to snap the PCB in several places, and you can see where the metal frame got bent as well. Yesterday I picked up some Krazy Glue in preparation for the attempt for a big fix. I figured that particular glue would likely be the best way to hope to put the PCB back together as it does a really solid job bonding plastics. On the negative side, I am always getting this stuff stuck to my fingers and all over the place&amp;hellip; so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exact thrilled to be working with it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track comes courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=691&amp;amp;sid=7d0cdf19c7200d2c7faafcb7c573a9ee&#34;&gt;STBB Forever BB #695&lt;/a&gt;, there were two tracks to chop up. The rules were effectively to chop whatever, use your own drums, no external instruments, and you needed to drop a change up in the track. I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see what others do this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the MPC BB this week, I was really crunched for time to work on this. This time however I decided I would just do the track in the PO-33, and make it a quick flip. So I loaded the tracks into the MPC, but didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother chopping on the MPC, I just shuffled the starting point around the tracks and sampled in what ever I wanted to start or stop, and was able to get four or five interesting chops pretty quickly from the first track. For the second track, I just sampled roughly a loop, and let the auto chopper do it&amp;rsquo;s magic, or horrible destruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This picture comes courtesy of Photoshop Camera on the iPhone with one of the goofy filters. I was out RV&amp;rsquo;ing with my family and my parents for a couple of days over the weekend&amp;hellip; which held me up from having time to pull together more of a track. I was split on the track this week, and was messing around on Sunday afternoon on the MPC, and the yesterday I flipped to try to put a track together on the PO-33.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well my first statement here is, if it says Non-Functioning&amp;hellip; be prepared for the device to not function :D. I was interested in getting a repair project underway, and see if I could breath some new life into a busted device, and while I thought this was going to be a case of soldering work&amp;hellip; well check this out&amp;hellip; while I am pretty sure it is worth what I paid for it in parts, well I&amp;rsquo;m just saddened to see how beat up this really is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now down to one listing on Reverb to sell off&amp;hellip; which kind of feels insane to me, and got me thinking about what I have sold off over the years, and why I sold it off. I also have to say, I cannot believe just how much prices have gone up over the last three months for a lot of this used gear. Yeah, I know it is not manufactured any more, and I know a lot of the stuff I have sold off people are now collecting for &amp;ldquo;that sound&amp;rdquo;, but yikes are the prices crazy. Is that a weird way to say &amp;ldquo;never been a better time to sell off used gear&amp;rdquo;, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some explanation I gave over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=198904&amp;amp;p=1798905#p1798905&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt; to help explain how an MPC works if you&amp;rsquo;re coming from and Ableton Live environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came from Ableton myself… and it&amp;rsquo;s a much different environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main things to get your head wrapped around on the MPC is sampling and sample management, programs (drums and key groups mostly), tracks and how to drop notes across various tracks to group things, and sequences to hold each section of your song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New Beat Battle up at &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=682&#34;&gt;STBB Forever #694&lt;/a&gt;. Was a fun one, and I pulled content from the four tracks. A lot of cool things to sample, and the rules were effectively no hats, and record your own percussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled a lot of fun glass bell, horns, strings, piano, etc&amp;hellip; all sounded really good. I just focussed on straight up one shot type sounds, and maybe a few hits with a bit of extra sound on them. I was able to put together quite a few tracks and sequences on the MPC, but honestly a lot of them just didn&amp;rsquo;t work together well, so I grabbed the sections I thought worked well enough and strung them together as best I could. So yeah, not exactly proud of this track, but I am trying to keep putting tracks together and retraining my ear for these things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weeks &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=198794&#34;&gt;MPC Forums BB 282&lt;/a&gt; is a go! This week&amp;rsquo;s challenge is to use an instrumental style track, and to make a trap beat, with a boom bap build up. I&amp;rsquo;m not terribly familiar with making trap beats, but I know the genre well enough to give it a go. Besides, trap is what dark vibes, ratchets, whoa/yeah/what shoutouts, and is pretty diverse BPM wise. I guess I forgot the shoutouts on my track though, so at least one mistake. Or was it? No, I forgot to put in some murmurs, shout outs, etc&amp;hellip; but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m going back to update the track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My sister has released the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/SOMNIUM-Beyond-Darkness-D-Sterling-ebook/dp/B087T5TVSS#ace-g1639449406&#34;&gt;SOMNIUM Beyond the Darkness&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon as a kindle book and as a paperback book, which is an excellent read for young adults and adults alike. She&amp;rsquo;s been looking to expand out into the audio book space, which makes sense to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had been looking into some voice actors who could read the book. When I heard the audio quality of the demo, it was rather poor. We were hoping that it was just a quick demo, but it suffered from a lot of background noise. My sister passed on links to the voice actor, and the demo&amp;rsquo;s she had on her website were great. After I gave my sister a few questions to ask and suggestions for contract negotiations, unfortunately it fell through. We suspect that the voice actor recorded her website demo at a professional studio, and likely recorded the demo she produced for my sister at home. Total bummer, but it&amp;rsquo;s better to both live and learn, and get through these miss steps early is what I always say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I rushed my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt; beat battle submission, and ended up deciding to post a track to &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/index.php&#34;&gt;STBB Forever&lt;/a&gt; this time. Not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ll dive deep into the STBB community and beat battles or not, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to find some other communities and see what may or may not stick with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=674&#34;&gt;STBB #693&lt;/a&gt; track, there was a *lot* of content to parse through, and there was a lot that would absolutely trip up on a submission to YouTube or Soundcloud. So, who knows how long my submission will last, but it is posted for now. The rules were pretty simple, use something from every track, no snares on 2 or 4, and something about being able to used instruments, but no sampled melodic content. I decided to just use all of the content just from the tracks, that&amp;rsquo;s been most of my style lately, and it makes it more of a fun challenge to see what you can squeeze out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boy, I thought I had posted this track a while ago&amp;hellip; heck I made it nearly a year ago, but here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-sounds-of-the-reliquary&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-sounds-of-the-reliquary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this track together in about an hour, and it was recorded on the Teenage Engineering OP-1 in conjunction with a Bastl Instruments Micro Granny. I spent a lot of time working out sounds to get it fairly noisy, and making it sound like it had some dark, odd vocal sounding components. The Micro Granny provided a lot of the ground work for those sounds, and I then spent some time to find string instruments on the OP-1 and played them at various tape speeds to get a more stretched out sound.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and looking to integrate CV output from your MPC so that you can track out gate and CV to devices that will take CV input, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a difference from the MPC X to the MPC Live mk2 / One. On the MPC X, it has eight discrete CV output jacks, so you can connect a TS 1/8&amp;quot; cable to the jack to each of the CV ports for each channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This here is the fourth album I put together, and it is steeped in Ableton Live&amp;hellip; Live 2.0 and beyond I believe. I&amp;rsquo;d have to go back and look&amp;hellip; if I could even find the old project files&amp;hellip; woof. Most of this is just taking loop libraries, sometimes chopping them, but probably mostly just placing the loops on the timeline and mixing the volume levels. I had been reading a lot about Ableton at the time and it was getting a lot of hype. Note: I still miss the old warping method&amp;hellip; *sigh*&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is curtesy of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=198504&#34;&gt;MPC Forums Beat Battle 281&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was going to do a DnB track, but unfortunately pk1 posted one of his own tracks on accident. Sadly, no DnB track dropping for now. Here&amp;rsquo;s the snippet of what I was messing around with in case you are interested. You can see, Amy is super thrilled for being in the picture!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t more than an hour into sampling and chopping, and had just started to sample a few instrument sounds. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rezo-bass-mpc-x.zip&#34;&gt;Rezo Bass for the MPC X/Live/One&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a bass sound that didn&amp;rsquo;t even make it into the DnB track. I had literally just sampled it and saw the &amp;ldquo;oops&amp;rdquo; post. Anyways&amp;hellip; somewhat of a lost opportunity as I had wanted to do a DnB track for a change, but also figured I had invested enough time and energy and wanted to go a different direction with the next track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are at least as many workflows as there are people doing it. There are certainly wrong ways to approach it, but don&amp;rsquo;t let anybody fool you by saying they know &amp;ldquo;the one way&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a beat battle, the two most important things are to familiarize yourself with the rules, and familiarize yourself with the samples. These two things will likely be the most important for setting your direction and where you want to experiment or challenge yourself, and knowing where you can safely stick to basics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a response I had for Danoc on the MPC Forums thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=198461&#34;&gt;Drum Techniques 4 Da MPC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to lead off with &amp;ldquo;if it sounds good, it is good&amp;rdquo;. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that everybody else will like it, but it can be important to go with your gut. While chopping with a GUI sure is handy, it also can lead to some very &amp;lsquo;same&amp;rsquo; chops. So if a chop that is early or late works for you, does not mean it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The beat battle is active for another couple days, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=198305&amp;amp;start=15&#34;&gt;BB 280&lt;/a&gt;. The rules are pretty simple, just use the two samples provided, and no outside content. Also, a 1:30 time cap, so no run on pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image comes from a picture I took while on a work trip to Bangalore. Which reminds me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/bb-280-funky-dream&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/bb-280-funky-dream&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple of hours and created a lot of different sequences to play with. Some of the components vibed better than others together. Parts were either too high energy or too low energy, so I ended up taking the components I liked the most and putting them together into something that I felt was as coherent as possible without killing a lot of time on this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=505</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for something completely different, and happened to stumble upon this Reddit thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/OP1users/comments/5gkx43/download_op1_patches_op1_14203/&#34;&gt;[DOWNLOAD] OP-1 Patches (op1_14203)&lt;/a&gt; which was posted to the OP-1 sub forum for users that wanted access to the older patches provided by the older OP-1 firmware. The direct link is currently still available to a google drive folder that somebody was nice enough too put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6r0Q-Lf6Fe5QVoxV3RBYm5DaFU&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is an interesting find, because it isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy to find the older firmware for devices, and often when you do find the older firmware it is missing a lot of features and functionality to the point of not wanting to downgrade. What is great about these patches is that they are drop in replacements for the OP-1 and gives you some view into what the older firmware was able to do with sampling and the sound engines, without the need to downgrade your device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to get back into flipping samples again lately, and done a few other beat battles. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll post them. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in seeing some of the discussion and submissions check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=197867&#34;&gt;MPC Forums BB 279 Thread&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely a lot of good content there, and some really great flips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach has been to just spend 60-90 minutes on each battle, so instead of trying to get a full track or perfect mix, just go for speed of getting something workable and putting it together quickly. This battle was no different, and while I&amp;rsquo;m not excited for the track exactly, it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track started life on the MPC X, and I did everything I could to try and use Clip mode to create loops. How the MPC X handles clips is close to what I need, especially compared to how previous versions handled clips&amp;hellip; but I have to say, it is not quite there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got two main problems with how the MPC X handles clips. The first problem is that the looper cannot be used in real time in many instances, because you are forced to take audio off of your inputs (mostly fine) or resampling (not really fine). Resampling means that you&amp;rsquo;ve got to take a break in your workflow if you want to resample something you are doing live while running other audio. The other problem I hit was that when you export the loop from audio to a sample, when you assign it in clip mode, it does some kind of strange BPM timing&amp;hellip; and this almost never matched what the project I was working on. Although my project was 96bpm, it would just assume what seemed like a random BPM 90% of the time, and with warping on it would sound like hot stretched garbage, even with the Pro Ten warping turned on. This is a big bummer and doesn&amp;rsquo;t bode well for using the MPC X as something you could use in a live environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you can believe it&amp;hellip; this came as a result of two different tracks built pretty much at the same time on the PO-33. This one was made up of 12 patterns, the other one used the other 4 to mess around (I&amp;rsquo;ll post the other track below). The same samples led to completely different inspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/BRw5bR-GOIU&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/BRw5bR-GOIU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure that I&amp;rsquo;ll keep doing these kinds of visual videos or not&amp;hellip; it added a bit more production time to something I just wanted to goof around with. Plus, since it was posted (a month ago) it&amp;rsquo;s only gotten one view&amp;hellip; so yeah&amp;hellip; not terribly popular. It was fun to play around with the software on my iPad though, so I suppose it isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete loss. I&amp;rsquo;ll just need to keep my mind open and learn.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working on restoring an Akai S1000 that I picked up on eBay, and it has needed some help. To put it nicely the previous owner seems to have let it go, and maintenance was not on the forefront of their mind. Not a big problem per se, but the box it arrived in was a mess, and it was very poorly packed. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this S1000 had seen much love in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai S950 Memory Upgrade</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Akai S950 is not too hard to upgrade, and there are not too many options. One upgrade that can be important is to increase the amount of memory that your S950 has, since it can triple your sample time. Before you start though, make sure you don&amp;rsquo;t forget to unplug the Akai S950 from power. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to accidentally fry your S950 or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get access to the memory ports to install by taking the bottom off. To make life easier I normally draw a small picture and place the screws onto the picture so that I can put the same screw back into the same spot. This helps so that you don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally put the wrong screw into the wrong spot and accidentally strip out the metal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a patch I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with on my eurorack gear while I am awaiting the case to get everything installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent for this recording wasn&amp;rsquo;t to get a clean sound&amp;hellip; and yeah&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m just using my cellphone mic. I was mostly testing out a new stand I got to see how much bump/wabble/wiggle the stand introduced in the video. You can hear some background noise (sorry about that), but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too interested in hooking up a proper audio recording device to sync everything. Probably next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of folks have been looking for track splitting technology as a holy grail for a while, and figured it&amp;rsquo;d be worth dropping a post. I originally posted this over at MPC Forums &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;t=197608&#34;&gt;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;amp;t=197608&lt;/a&gt; so if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an MPC head&amp;rsquo;s take on this tech&amp;hellip; check it out over that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First word of warning… this is super nerdy, and requires a fair bit of knowledge to get working. Here&amp;rsquo;s the video I accidentally stumbled upon that turned me on to this tech&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the third album I put together and was still heavily influenced by Acid Pro, I think I was using Acid Pro 4.0. I was getting far more comfortable using loops, the interface, and was starting to incorporate the Triton Studio into my productions too. Sometimes I would play a lot by hand, other times I was just playing chords and letting the arpeggiator do a lot of the work for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to link off to anything I am selling, as I am not looking to drive attention to it or try and raise awareness. Instead I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write up why I am going about selling gear off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I have really been looking to tighten up my process for making music. I also have spent about twenty years collecting gear, and some of that gear has had a habit of collecting dust. It is no particular fault of the gear, but when we work on music we&amp;rsquo;re constantly making choices, and a lot of my choices are of the type &amp;ldquo;this versus that&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I know how to use this really well and that other device not so much&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start by explaining the patch a bit, and how I got here&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life started off on the Akai S950, using piano multi samples from G1 through C4, every sixth note&amp;hellip; My goal was to get some of that S950 12-bit grit and artifacts, but still keep it relatively free of the crazy stretching artifacts you can get by just sampling a single note and stretching it across the entire keyboard. This way, it maintains a lot of the characteristics of a piano, instead of heading into the field of creating what sounds like a more synthetic instrument.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really happy with this, but I also had a bit of a gap for #Jamuary. Guess it was too much to think I&amp;rsquo;d put something together every day. On the other hand, it is freeing to have just taken a few takes, and going for the best of them so that I can move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything too special here, and I actually sampled way more than I ended up using. Some of the other tracks I&amp;rsquo;ve posted I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of going back and actually tracking them out and mixing them up a bit, but this one I was super into last week, and now it just kind of falls flat for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this audio sitting on my OP-1 for a while (okay two weeks), and while I&amp;rsquo;d like to have sampled and chopped it up some, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d send it out into the universe. I had sent the loops over to my father and brother in-law to see if either of them wanted to try and play some guitar over it. Unfortunately that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Maybe they were too intimidated, I mean this is super awesome! If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in playing around with or adding something to this track, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear it, so link something in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No eurorack modules were harmed in the making of this video. The PO-32 (Tonic) makes up the drums, the PO-35 (Voice) is how I got the &amp;ldquo;No More Technology&amp;rdquo; hook, and&amp;hellip; the lead/bass came from some Eurorack mess. I recorded all of this into Ableton Live for some FX processing. All of this was recorded back in October/November, and I&amp;rsquo;ve meant to create a finished track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of #Jamuary though, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d break out some gear and refine the track a bit more. I&amp;rsquo;m really trying to cap myself to about 30-60 minutes of production time this month for each song. This is good in some ways because it&amp;rsquo;s forcing me to get ideas down, but it is bad in a few other ways since I&amp;rsquo;m really not mixing/mastering anything. Leaving this track with a bit more of a tinny sound than I&amp;rsquo;d like, but hey it is what it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image is courtesy of a road trip I did with my family from the East Coast out to Montana. On the way back we stopped at an amethyst mine, and I got some really cool pictures of some older beat up vehicles. There was some really cool stuff going on here, and we got some neat amethyst crystals to bring back home with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the song, nothing too fancy here, just using samples of thumps and bumps from everyday objects. A lot of the magic is just pitching things up and down, using filters&amp;hellip; and then just jamming it out. I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick with the PO-33 a bit longer, but a lot of the initial magic playing around with the FX again is a bit gone, it has now gone from being novel to producing some pretty similar sounds to my ear. The device is still fantastic, and it might just be time for me start considering what I am going to move on to for a device to keep going on making tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image is from my daughter. While we took a trip out to Montana she kept borrowing my phone to take strange pictures with odd filters. This is one of many featuring one of our dogs. It looked intense enough to be a good track image. Enjoy the image of my dog slowly zooming in while listening to a electro song plays!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing&amp;hellip; I was going to do another house track, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d place it quite in that genre, is it electro house? I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is fast enough for Techno&amp;hellip; Somebody who has more refined taste might be able to clarify the music genre for me. I just thought it sounded cool!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used some Washi tape to label the write and record on the PO-33 on the case. I keep pushing the wrong one and deleting samples or otherwise overwriting stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t want to. I&amp;rsquo;m just not keeping the two clear in my mind. Also, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that the write button with the white dot reminds me of a record button&amp;hellip; but yeah, it is still me! :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m really sticking with one or two drum loops, some vocals chopped up by and amateur (well the PO-33), an instrument sound, and maybe a bass sound. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to do something different to push myself to not fall into a track. And&amp;hellip; This track fell out of the sky! Well rather, I just recorded off some more samples to see what I could do to push the PO-33 a bit more. By pushing, I mostly mean doing even more FX and changing the FX up more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had intended in jamming out on the MPC today, but I ended up grabbing the PO 33 again&amp;hellip; Producing another small track. Seriously folks, I am surprised at how much big sound can come out of such a small device! This is maybe 30 minutes worth of playing around max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a laugh, this is maybe seven, max eight, seconds of audio samples. If I actually put the effort in to trim down the wasted space in the drum track, I might be able to get it down to four or five seconds. Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not bothered by it, but it really goes to show even with the old school hardware and multiple limitations, those older machines really could knock out some bangers without too much effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been happily selling off gear, I&amp;rsquo;ve still got the Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators I picked up a while back. I was feeling like putting something together super fast, and while I was planning on recording off samples, creating drum programs, all that fun stuff&amp;hellip; I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend too much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I reached for my trusty PO-33 and decided to sample in some beats. Originally I was going to use the internal microphone, but while this is sometimes interesting, there was a bit too much background noise (ie, the kid wouldn&amp;rsquo;t stop singing Frozen songs). I had to use the line in, which honestly does tend to have a fuller sound, the microphone is fine, but often it does lack the bottom end a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well now, this has been sitting in my drafts for way to long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this even come from? Oh yeah, I made the loop in Reason, using a piano patch&amp;hellip; which one *shrug*, I forget. But I definitely used the Scream FX to add some wow/flutter, how much? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; take a listen?&lt;/p&gt;

Yeah yeah&amp;hellip; I usually do my own chopping and sampling&amp;hellip; but I was more interested in just putting something together quick and checking out how hot the output levels are on the MPC X, and how badly distorted it would get going through the Chase Bliss pedals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I am normally a bit of a hardware snob lately&amp;hellip; I cannot help but continue to be wow&amp;rsquo;d by just how far software has come, and where software continues to be going. For all the lack of knobs, you often get an incredible amount of features, as well as a reduced price of entry. Sure, you&amp;rsquo;re ignoring the cost of the computer, but most people these days have one anyways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, here&amp;rsquo;s a video I recorded for the festivities today. A single sleigh bell sound, processed through a bunch of Chase Bliss Audio effects and pedals. This is not a song, think of it more as an FX test.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I broke down and got a guitar pedal board today, so I could more easily work with multiple pedals. Before it was one at a time, but not any more. Now I can run them in series and mix and match for some more interesting effects. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to start posting about putting the pedal board together and powering it. Oh and hacking on the plastic to get everything to fit, but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that for another day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh the joys of owning older gear.  Q2 on my MPC was super sketchy.  Loading up the JJOS v3 test menu showed Q2 was going from a range of about 300-500, and normal operation is 0-1000.  Another fun problem was that moving Q1 was also making a subtle change to Q2.  That&amp;rsquo;s definitely not supposed to happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured there were a few things to try in order to resolve this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I decided to play around with Reason again, and ended up recording the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lofi-house-mpc-1k-program.zip&#34;&gt;LoFi House MPC 1k Program&lt;/a&gt;. Really nothing too fancy, but other than routing drums through a 12-bit distortion Rack Extension, with a bunch of tweaking to filter it a bit. Honestly, each drum hit could be better tweaked for a tighter sound, but I ran out of sampling steam. Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll come back to a round two (or three) of these samples and trying and put something together a bit more consistent. So nothing too epic, but I figured it would be fun to play around with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>String Loss Program for Akai MPC 1000</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This came as an experiment playing with some string sounds from the OP-1 String engine and and using the Chase Bliss Mood for the effects. I recorded into the granular tape effect, and sent the output through the slip effect, giving the sound quite a level of character. The initial recording is &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/string-loss.wav&#34;&gt;String Loss&lt;/a&gt;, and to me it evokes a bit of a cutting and driving sound that exists somewhere between the string and organ family of sounds. It was pretty simple to chop up into a program, which resulted in &lt;a href=&#34;//neartao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/string-loss-mpc-1k.zip&#34;&gt;String Loss MPC 1k&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;ve really just been playing with the straight chops at different velocities, but I think for the song I&amp;rsquo;m building up I&amp;rsquo;m going to lean into some pitch shifting of the parts to see how I can really push the sounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pulling together on a track on my MPC 1k, and have been playing around with a few piano sounds. The initial sound comes from the OP-1, from the Fake Piano patch under the DR Wave engine. I liked this sound as a starting point, and it reminds me a bit of the old Casio keyboards from the 80&amp;rsquo;s. I changed the presets a bit, and in particular turned off the Spring reverb as this was giving it a bit too much presence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been getting back into using guitar pedals for external effects processing, and had some fun messing with the Chase Bliss Mood again. This started life as an Ableton Live clean Stratocaster patch that I put together, and played through the Mood. What I played initially sounded like an unaffected guitar, but with the Mood always listening, and using the old blood side&amp;rsquo;s always listening micro granular in tape mode, I came up with this bass sounding loop &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/moody-01.wav&#34;&gt;Moody Bass 01&lt;/a&gt;. This was recorded into my MPC 1000, and I sliced it into a drum kit &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/moody-bass-mpc-1k.zip&#34;&gt;Moody Bass&lt;/a&gt; for the MPC 1000 on JJOS. You can certainly take the initial loop and chop it in a different way, but I decided to just do a relatively clean chop and tightened up the start and end points in the drum kit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to see all kinds of cool gear out there, and wonder how it might impact your sound, followed by a purchase for something that you might not use. I can attest to this, because to even write this post I&amp;rsquo;ve clean off a lot of miscellaneous music gear from my desk just so I can have room to type. It has become a frequent habit of mine to pull out instruments and effects to start a project, only to then have too many options. This coming from somebody who&amp;rsquo;s been weaning off of software to get back into more of a hardware focus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OP-Z oplab Installation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The oplab module for my OP-Z finally showed up today. I ordered it back in July, and it&amp;rsquo;s been backordered for quite some time. I read on the op-forums people having problems with the oplab latch, warped cases, etc&amp;hellip; so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally sure how it was going to work out. I was certainly concerned that the oplab would not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut to the next fifteen minutes after installing the oplab module, and the best I could get out of it was a red flash, and then none of the blinking lights to show activity I expected. I tried hooking up the oplab outputs to various inputs on my eurorack, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to see any output triggering on my oscilloscope, gate triggers, or anything else. That was disappointing. I uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, tried squeezing the case in case there was a connection issue&amp;hellip; none of this helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found more album and artwork things! So let&amp;rsquo;s just get right to it for this, my second album, and originally published (okay, I burned it myself and printed out all the artwork) as a two album discography for friends and family. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet that all the copies made it to the trash or got exposed to the sun ruining my nicely burned CDs. Yeah, that was a thing back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was traveling to Bangalore for work Chase Bliss dropped the Generation Loss, and unfortunately I missed the pre-order window on Reverb. I tried to check it out the next day, but it was already sold out. I spent the next few days wondering if I really needed this device, or it was going to be an effect I should just pass on. I checked out the Knobs &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPONrJAyqfc&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; as well as Andy Othling&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2g-xM7Oj4k&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and I have to say, they both intrigued me. So I setup a feed on Reverb to keep me apprised of whenever Generation Loss might start showing up on the scalper market on Reverb and eBay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; I figured out to mount my old NAS box, and while it is a treasure trove of media, it is also a big, unsorted mess. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take some time for me to dig through and find albums, artwork, and put it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment I think I have settled on Bandcamp as a target to upload content. It seems to be reasonable service wise compared to soundcloud. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep playing around though. Below is the album, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The patch &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nt-old-school-cinema.zip&#34;&gt;Old School Cinema&lt;/a&gt; started life on the Pocket Operator Tonic. I recorded the hits into the Akai S950 at 10khz, because I was afraid that some of the longer bass notes would exhaust the sample memory, and honestly I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to be chopping on the S950 for an hour. I was able to squeeze everything into the roughly 60 seconds of sample time I had available at the 10khz sampling rate. Honestly, I could have probably squeezed it in a bit better, but I was trying to let some of the longer notes ring out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nothing too special, and I kept the sample size down. The sample range is from C0 through C4 so there is a pretty good range to play with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai S950 Tape Grand Piano for MPC X/Live</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2019/10/17/akai-s950-tape-grand-piano-for-mpc-x-live/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=106</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is my next patch for my MPC X &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nt-tape-grand-piano.zip&#34;&gt;Tape Grand Piano&lt;/a&gt;. I started with a multisample Grand Piano sampled into the Akai S950 at C/F note intervals. So samples a bit stretched, but it sounds pleasant enough, and certainly a bit more realistic than the strings a made recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patch was again routed through a tape effect to give it some not so subtle tape warble. A pretty big problem that I had making this patch, is that it is over 60 samples, and while the auto sampler in the MPC X/Live is nice, it isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete solution. So I ended up spending a fair amount of time trimming the samples, only to remember that there is still a bug that if you record the content through a single input, it still records the sample as stereo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai S950 String Program For MPC Live/X</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey everybody!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I spent some time trimming recording in a string sample into the Akai S950.  It was about 20 seconds or so long.  The idea was to make something that could be pitched up reasonably high and still have a reasonable length to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I completed sampling into the S950, I used my Akai MPC Live to create a mono sampled key group patch from the content.  The auto sampler tried to put in loop points, but they were completed busted, so I disabled sample looping.  I have to say, I do like some of the sounds in the lower keys (C0-C1), as the stretching from the S950 sounds pretty heavy and dark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
