    <p>For the picture that‚Äôs not real smoke/steam, but boy does it feel like there is something going on in my wrist.
Saw a nurse practitioner.
Pretty sure it‚Äôs not CTS. I noticed a lump on my wrist now that the swelling is down a bit‚Ä¶ and it is likely I‚Äôve got a ganglion cyst near my palm attached to one of the tendons. I can feel it is a bit mushy on the tendon, and it moves when I move my fingers. It‚Äôs quite possible that this additional mass is pushing on some of the veins, and it‚Äôs likely also getting caught up on my other tendons when I move my hand.

With the pandemic, and the shift in how I use my time, I haven‚Äôt had the time while driving to sit down and really listen, which has resulted in a massive backlog of nearly a hundred hours of unlisted to podcasts.

My wife and I are doing everything we can to keep our daughter in as socially normal atmosphere as possible, but we‚Äôre really keeping to ourselves otherwise.
It‚Äôs been weird too, because just as COVID-19 broke out I was starting a new job, getting ready to meet new people, and drive new projects. My job is fully online now, which is a larger change than I anticipated. Previously I was traveling a lot, getting together with people to make sure we were moving products, and overall very highly connected. Now I am keeping people focused in meetings, helping get programs on the rails or stay on the rails,

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So here is a bit of a quandary for me. About a week and a half ago I hit a 59 day streak for closing all of the rings on the Apple Watch, and then it stopped. In the last two weeks I have not been closing all of my rings despite my exercise right being frequently over flowing. What is going on?
I spent some time thinking about this and if I should be upset with myself or not. I had been really looking to get healthier over the last few months, and boy do I feel like I have in some ways disappointed myself by not closing all of the rings. As with many things in life though, I had to spend some time considering why this may not be the case.

    <p>I hit a 53 day move/stand/exercise streak, and I am not going to lie to you, mentally it has not gotten too much easier than it has been.

I guess it is more philosophical in some ways, because yeah, I know this is important for my health, but a big question that keeps coming up for me is why. Why do I want or need to be healthier? Do I need to loose weight? How much better shape do I need to be in? These questions are certainly all normal, and I do have the answers to them for myself, but I‚Äôm finding it important to remind myself more often.
