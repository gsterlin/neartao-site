      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I feel like I am stuck for ideas, one thing I like to do is rapid brainstorms. This is especially helpful for me because there is a tendency to get pushed into a specific train of thought, and sometimes I just want to move outside of the box that I have put myself in. In order to push myself I find it helpful to come up with as many random ideas to address a topic as I can within a short period of time. The idea is not to get 25 great ideas, but instead to explore thoughts that you might have otherwise ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
