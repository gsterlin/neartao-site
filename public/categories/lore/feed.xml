      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pictured above is our family dog Abbey, our very own German Shepherd. I want to say my parents got her when I was around twelve or fourteen, and this picture was taken when I was probably twenty or twenty two at my parent&amp;rsquo;s house. Abbey was our second dog, Sonya had the honor of being our first dog and was a black lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbey was a great dog, though she could be a bit of a worry wart, and was definitely over protective, but she could also get quite scared. She was a kennel pup, and sadly when we got her, her tail had been broken in three places. We&amp;rsquo;d often get asked if she was mixed because her tail tended to curl upwards a lot, where as most German Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s have much straighter tails. For this reason, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get a dog that came from a kennel ever again. You just don&amp;rsquo;t know what the breeder, delivery person, or the pet store may have done to the animal, and it gives too much room for everybody to point their fingers at each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
