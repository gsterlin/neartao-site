  <div class="post-content"><p>This is a weird one for me for sure. I got an email that congratulated me for being in the top 2% of earners for buymeacoffee.com. Before you all start celebrating me and my &ldquo;wild success&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m going to drop some details, some thoughts, and probably a few opinions.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with where I am today. My online digital &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; is kind of a mess, where I have accounts for all kinds of services, and I sort of know why I put some content somewhere, but also feel like I&rsquo;m probably spread a bit too thin if I was trying to make a living out of all of this. I&rsquo;m not really trying to make a living out of all of this, so that&rsquo;s a good thing, but due to my &ldquo;anti-capitalistic&rdquo; behavior, I also get a peek into understanding why all this social media stuff is so hard from time to time.</p>
<p>What sites?</p>
<p>The most used accounts are probably on YouTube, Wordpress, BuyMeACoffee, Discord, and Patreon. I&rsquo;ve also got accounts on Instagram, X, SoundCloud, and a bunch of other social media. I&rsquo;ll post tracks or other random things on SoundCloud from time to time, but besides having other sites post stuff &ldquo;on my behalf&rdquo; to Instagram or X, or what have you, they don&rsquo;t get much use from me. If I was trying to hustle and make serious money from all of the work I&rsquo;ve put in, I&rsquo;d be out there advertising, adding &ldquo;buy whatever&rdquo; bumpers to all my videos, and chasing all the latest trends that I could get my hands on.</p>
<p>For anybody that has paid attention to what I&rsquo;ve been working on over the last&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know&hellip; decade or so now?&hellip; In the past I have used YouTube and SoundCloud mostly interchangeably, as a place to post music. I would, in the past, post pretty frequent blog posts on this Wordpress site with whatever thoughts, learning lessons, or whatever else came to mind. I&rsquo;d post information about the MPC, maybe the SP202 or SP303, the OP-1, or whatever else rather sporadically. In general, these videos are posts were to help answer folks who had questions on various forums, and it felt like a more direct way to answer somebody to help them out.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p>For starters, I got burnt out by watching a lot of the music YouTubers out there just chasing whatever the new &ldquo;hotness&rdquo; was. It was probably more of a &ldquo;me not you&rdquo; mental change, but I just was getting exhausted with the hyper aggressive very market focussed change. Broadly, it felt to me like a lot of successful YouTubers had pivoted from caring about instruments and their fan base to caring about how to get free gear or how to make a buck. I don&rsquo;t want to throw shade on anybody, but it was disheartening to watch, and honestly continue to watch. That said, it&rsquo;s easy to call somebody a shill, heck I&rsquo;ve been called one from time to time for all the SP404 mk2 I&rsquo;ve made&hellip; so what do I know.</p>
<p>Around this time, I started taking a lot of notes about the SP404 mk2, and thought about turning it into a guide, just trying to give as much truthful and factual information as possible, and couple it with as much personal experience or why I think something was important or useful as possible. Honestly, I did it for *me*, but I wanted to give it out to the community for free. I know I&rsquo;ve talked about this before, but I put it out there for free for two main reasons. First, I believe strongly in education and helping others, and I felt that by doing this for free the guide could have a broad impact on people being able to express themself. Second, there&rsquo;s a level of ownership that others have when they pay you for something that I just didn&rsquo;t want. It&rsquo;s not that I want to keep my hands up and push people away or anything, but to be able to do things on my own time requires or in my own voice, not attached to a dollar value requires me to do a lot of this work for free.</p>
<p>Anyways, about two and a half years ago, when the SP404 mk2 released, I saw some really shady &ldquo;masterclass&rdquo; style SP404 mk2 content get released as paid content, and it felt super low quality, and honestly didn&rsquo;t seem very engaging. I really felt that even with low production values on my part, I could do better. Also, why not just iteratively learn *how* to get better at doing these kinds of things. Anybody who goes back to my older videos will know that the audio is rather poor (being generous), but I&rsquo;m hoping the newer content comes across that much better today. I&rsquo;m also not trying to get the best shots, or improve cameras, or worry about lighting. It hasn&rsquo;t been the point for me. Sure it could get more views if I do all that, but then I&rsquo;ll be worried about recovering money for my investment.</p>
<p>Where Are We Today?</p>
<p>It is like a link soup all of this. Heck I&rsquo;m just going to just post what I had said over at Elektronauts ( <a href="https://www.elektronauts.com/t/roland-sp-404-mk2-part-2/211287/690">https://www.elektronauts.com/t/roland-sp-404-mk2-part-2/211287/690</a>)</p>

</ul>
<p>The Buy Me A Coffee shop was setup with some downloadable items listed. I can set the prices as low as $1 (maybe even $0) which is nice, though file upload limits are annoying. I‚Äôve put together some sound sets and things, and most of the descriptions have links to go to if you want to download some (or in some cases all) of the content for free. I‚Äôm mostly putting these sound sets here as a place to aggregate some of the things I‚Äôve done over the years that might start to get harder to find. I‚Äôm also paying for probably too many hosting services and will at some point try and collapse down to a smaller number of systems.</p>

</ul>
<p>One of the services I pay for‚Ä¶ Wordpress. It‚Äôs not unbelievably pricey, but is really just a place I generally just upload files to lately instead of blogging. The link goes to the latest ‚Äúfreely available‚Äù guide, it covers version 3.x. People from time to time reach out and ask how to support me, and I‚Äôve settled on publishing interim ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù or ‚Äúminor update‚Äù versions of the guide to my Patreon for subscribers only‚Ä¶ I am in the process of updating the guide to firmware 4.04‚Ä¶ but subscribers can get the minor updates as they happen‚Ä¶</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/neartaos-sp404-4-101911920">https://www.patreon.com/posts/neartaos-sp404-4-101911920</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Patreon link should take you directly to the freely available quick reference. It‚Äôs pretty easy for most people to print out and make themselves, and I‚Äôve posted a YouTube video on how to do it. There is a link for a paid version over at BuyMeACoffee, which exists entirely outside of Patreon because as far as I can tell, there isn‚Äôt a good way to ask a questionnaire for things like shipping address. I‚Äôm charging $10 to make the quick reference by hand and ship it out. On Patreon there isn‚Äôt really a good way to charge ‚Äúless than $5‚Äù for most anything‚Ä¶ and it looks like a hassle to have custom forms when people buy something‚Ä¶ between Patreon and BuyMeACoffee I feel like I can get most of the ‚Äúlow cost‚Äù and ‚Äúhassle free‚Äù and heck even ‚Äúgive stuff away for free‚Äù, but neither has proven to be a one stop shop for what I am trying to do‚Ä¶ which is mostly get information out there, and let people pay what they want, if anything.</p>

<p>My YouTube channel is where you‚Äôll probably find the most consistent updates. I seem to get the most questions and things here, and I have in the past tried to stick to posting at least one video a day. It has gotten a bit harder to keep up, and I‚Äôm¬†<em>just</em>¬†getting around to posting videos on the 4.04 firmware update, but it‚Äôs still going along.</p>

</ul>
<p>I‚Äôve got a discord server going as well‚Ä¶ pretty sleepy, though from time to time questions get asked or I‚Äôll make some time to hop onto voice chat and answer questions. Honestly, it‚Äôs mostly used as a table top rpg server for a few games I run with some friends, but I‚Äôm always happy to hang out with anybody if I‚Äôve got the time.</p>
<p>Why All This?</p>
<p>As you can read from above, I haven&rsquo;t really settled on any single way to provide a service or anything. It is nice to get a bit of passive income out of all the work I&rsquo;ve put in, but I&rsquo;d also rather keep as much goodwill with the community I have built as it were. Which means I get a handful of donations from various places from time to time, and for that I am grateful that somebody would care enough to drop a few dollars for anything. I&rsquo;d prefer to pull everything together into a single donation, subscription, or other service, but all of these services have their hand out in various ways. YouTube wants you to have memberships to give early access to videos. I get it they want you to go through them so they can get their piece of the pie, but I&rsquo;d rather use something like Patreon or BuyMeACoffee to manage other services as well more broadly. Patreon offers a video service, but then I need to transcode videos to a different format, which has its own hassles. BuyMeACoffee would be a great platform instead of Patreon, but it has a file size limit around 180-200mb or something, which breaks a lot of content I&rsquo;d like to publish.</p>
<p>Which leaves me spreading myself thinner across all of these services. Which I guess I&rsquo;ll continue to shrug to for now.</p>
<p>Passive Income Breakdown</p>
<p>Maybe this is what you wanted to come here for, to see behind the scenes a bit.</p>
<p>YouTube Channel</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at YouTube videos for starters. I&rsquo;ve posted well over 730 videos, that are generally 5-8 minutes long. I&rsquo;ll be generous and say that they are 5 minutes. On average I record a video about 1.3 times (sometimes I nail it the first time, sometimes I do a few takes). I try to respond to questions and comments in each video which might account for about 7 minutes per video. It also takes me about 10 minutes to upload, write in the descriptions, fill out forms and all of that. I&rsquo;ll break down the math for time investment per video as (5m * 1.3) + 7m + 10m per video, or about 23.5 minutes invested per video. 23.5 minutes * 730 videos works out to bout 17,155 minutes or 286 hours of time investment, just on the YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Over the last year, well 17 months, I have made about $20-$60 in advertisement revenue for the videos per month. I&rsquo;d guess that the average is about $40, which is maybe $480 a year. It&rsquo;s not bad, but works out to about $1.67 per hour, for my (probably low balled) investment of time. I know I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;trying&rdquo; in the traditional sense to make a YouTube career, but those kinds of numbers are pretty terrible, and makes me better understand why YouTubers who are trying to make a living out of this swing into doing whatever is trendy in the moment, and ultimately burning out because I&rsquo;d imagine they are putting in far more time and money, and might not be getting much better of an investment out of it for themself.</p>
<p>The SP404 mk2 Guide</p>
<p>The guide honestly, is going to be much worse to break down, but mostly because anything that has a zero in it is going to be terrible, and I do charge zero for it. Still, I don&rsquo;t think a lot of people appreciate the amount of time that has gone into that either, but my rough estimate is that it takes about two hours per page on average to write, edit, update, and maintain. The current state of the guide is about 180 pages I think, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it was about 360 hours of work over the last two and a half years. The upfront cost was high to actually get it to 1.x, and both 2.x and 3.x brought in substantial changes. I&rsquo;m in the middle of updating the guide to 4.04, and there&rsquo;s just so many things to check and proofread, that the time does add up. So I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it&rsquo;s at least another 40-80 hours to get all of the updates in place for the 4.04 version of the guide, and beyond a few BuyMeACoffee donations (maybe $60&rsquo;ish), I haven&rsquo;t really gotten much out of it.</p>
<p>I do get people who reach out to me from time to time about publishing a physical copy of the guide, but I&rsquo;ll be honest, just to pay for a trial run of it, or to pay for some test copies to see how it looks, just makes the proposition worse. Especially when I&rsquo;d expect to see around 10-20 sales at best, and I don&rsquo;t want to be charging an arm and a leg for it. Could I be convinced that there&rsquo;s a way to do it? Perhaps, but I don&rsquo;t really see a sane way to do it, when my philosophy has been to keep costs as low as possible.</p>
<p>Acid Drop Release</p>
<p>I spent *so* much time working on this sample pack. Not as much as the guide or YouTube videos, but checking notes and such, this was over 60 hours worth of time to sample, create patches, create patterns, and package everything. I was hoping it&rsquo;d be something that might generate some real sales and interest, and I think I&rsquo;ve seen a total of 9 sales, at $5 a pop. Now remember, I&rsquo;m not advertising these things much, and I&rsquo;m mostly doing these things for myself, but this was definitely a real bummer for me. I clearly had the wrong mindset going into it though, which is fine, but it is also the space where I&rsquo;m happy to give a lot of things away for free, but when I do that I obviously cannot be belly aching about why nobody is buying content later. So I have to give it a bit of a shrug and move on.</p>
<p>Quick Reference</p>
<p>This was another project where I&rsquo;ve just taken a ton of notes over the last two years, and was always trying to figure out how to put something together that might be useful for other people as well. While I haven&rsquo;t been big on publishing the guide, I figured a quick reference would actually be manageable for me to sell. The initial quick reference was about 30 hours to put together, between formatting, organizing, and redoing notes, and to update it for 4.04 was nearly another 40 hours due to how much I overhauled the look and feel, had to find space, and all of that fun stuff. So the quick reference, for literally being only 2 printed pages, is probably per page, my biggest investment in time.</p>
<p>I had considered making it a &ldquo;for sale only&rdquo; thing, but&hellip; and I must be a glutton for punishment, I figured I&rsquo;d put it out there for free to help people out, and to have for sale a physical copy. Even with the quick reference I understand that $10 is extravagant, especially for a single piece of paper, that I am giving away for free as well, plus the $10 includes all of the labor to print it, fold it, staple it, cut it, put it into an envelope, and pay for postage. I don&rsquo;t think most people understand just how manually intensive something like this is, especially when you get one off sales. At this point I&rsquo;ve sold 11 of them, and it is far more than I thought would sell based on previous trends for everything, but also far less than I was afraid of. When I launched it, I was concerned I&rsquo;d get over 100 orders and be manufacturing these little booklets for a week.</p>
<p>What about the 2%</p>
<p>Well&hellip; back here now&hellip; I got an email from BuyMeACoffee that said I was in the top 2% of earners on BuyMeACoffee. If you&rsquo;ve done the math, you can probably take a stab at a total, but I think I&rsquo;ve still made under $200 total on this site. If you take out expenses for buying envelopes, stamps, paper, toner, and everything else, well I am well below $200. If you consider that BuyMeACoffee, and the credit card companies get a cut of every sale as well, all I can say is, how is anybody making money out here?</p>
<p>At no point did this email make me think &ldquo;wow I&rsquo;ve made it&rdquo;, instead it more got me thinking, just how many struggling people are out there? Or maybe the site is full of bots trying to scam people out of money? I&rsquo;m not sure, but it&rsquo;s all kind of sad thoughts for me, because I know how much work and effort I&rsquo;ve put into all of this to get a tiny amount of recognition. All I can say is that I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not attaching any personal meaning for doing any of this work to a dollar value, because frankly, if I were, I&rsquo;d go insane from the grind.</p>
<p>All of this also does have me considering that I will keep Patreon and BuyMeACoffee going. I do want to find ways to put content out there for free, but also have some things that if people think they&rsquo;d like to toss a coin or two my way that they can help support in some way and still get something out of it. For now at least I still feel like putting sound sets together, writing the guide, and trying to help people out. It&rsquo;s fun and I do feel like the community has been great.</p>
