    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>If you want to check out the MPC Forums Challenge… this time we’re working on some Electro Funk here. Yeah, I’ve taken a break from some of the Beat Battles to work on some songs… and so far this is fun, and a good opportunity to dust off gear other than the sampler.
Here’s my notes so far.
The use of samples is really sparse, and I don’t think it’s how we’d think of sampling today. I do get a vibe of a much smaller sample set, where used, in the genre. I’m hearing some similar sounds here and there… some fx hits or stabs… which I’m not totally sure if these are off of a sample record, or just from a drum machine… but for me it really indicates that there really isn’t any complex sampling, pitch shifting, etc… and these are going to sound inauthentic in this genre. So for me, I’m likely going to avoid straight up sample tricks.

NT - Bells Download
The bells are sampled across a few octaves, but not tuned. Should just requires tuning the master, but I did not end up using them and got lazy. Since I am posting it for free, if you cannot do anything with it, well that’s on you! For those interested, this is sampled from Eurorack, in particular Elements is doing the heavy lifting, with some very minor FX on it to taste.

I’ll kick off first and foremost, this entire track was done on the MPC Live mk2. Not for any particular reason, but I started there, and just kept going. Being able to unplug the device while taking my daughter out to ballet, horseback riding, waiting for my wife to finish shopping… whatever it was, was certainly helpful. Besides auto sampling a few synths, everything was done in the box including fx, mixing, mastering, all that. I know a lot of folks know it is possible, but for those who doubt it, maybe this changes your mind? I actually expected a few times to want to be reaching for Ableton, Reason, or Melodyne to do a few things, but that was frequently when I was away from my computer and I just pushed my way through it.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My first MPC was the Akai MPC 1k Black. I really cut my teeth on this MPC over the years, and with JJOS it really made the MPC 1k shine. Life was pretty simple, but it had been given an amazing workflow for chopping, sampling, and writing music. I bought it back when the black model was released, and held on to it until just this year. Watching the prices of a lot of the old gear I had sky rocket, it was hard to justify keeping it around, especially since it was living mostly in it’s old box. As I’ve written about before, I really don’t want to keep old gear around for the sake of keeping it, and it was just time to part with the MPC 1k along with a lot of the other gear that has gone out the door, hopefully on to better homes that will appreciate and use the gear to the fullest.

This track is done from the STBB Forever #699 Beat Battle. I used the tracks provided, as well as a track that I did years ago to jam these tracks together. It is not a great track, and more just playing around. The rules were to use the provided samples, a beep, vocal or bleep track or whatever, and you could use outside sounds.
I don’t know why I had the idea to do a beat and then transition into a DnB/Jungle type of track… but I did it. Results were not so great though. It leaves for an awkward transition, and the second half only really hits the rules because I had a computerized vocal “beep” sound in it. So, uhm… I guess points for “creativity” maybe? But for actual execution this is kind of hot garbage.

The rules I went for were any external sounds allowed, but you have to sample whatever you want to add from a microphone. No mic simulations allowed.

As I said in the previous post, this track had to come together quite quickly… and this is maybe at best an hour worth of work. I scrambled to get it together and then added some decorative vocals and a baseline to boot.
In all seriousness this track is a bit over compressed, you can hear it especially when the hi hats slam into the available headroom. I guess I got too carried away with everything in the short amount of time… but I got what I got :D.

Alrighty then! So for this track, I started it and finished it in about 30 minutes. I just didn’t have much time to hit the deadline yesterday… and figured I’d just cut to the chase for the throw down. To pull this together I just grabbed a four bar section that I liked the sound of, chopped it, pitched it down, and then got to business laying out a track. I then searched through drums and kits to piece together something for drums, a little fx, and some bass that was halfway decent.

    <p>The picture is courtesy of a family of six foxes that have been living in our back yard for the last two seasons. We’ve been seeing them around for five or six years now. Definitely our suburban outdoor pets now. We’re not feeding them directly or anything… but they are certainly enjoying all of the wildlife that our bird feeders and gardens attract.
I’ve been working on just walking faster… I know, sounds silly, but the effort is really keeping my heart rate up higher. I used to get shin splints from running, and I’m just trying to keep this activity as low impact as possible.
