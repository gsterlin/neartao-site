This was done almost entirely on the MPC X for sequencing sections and building it out into a song‚Ä¶ in song mode. Haha!

    <p>Let me start by explaining the patch a bit, and how I got here‚Ä¶
Life started off on the Akai S950, using piano multi samples from G1 through C4, every sixth note‚Ä¶ My goal was to get some of that S950 12-bit grit and artifacts, but still keep it relatively free of the crazy stretching artifacts you can get by just sampling a single note and stretching it across the entire keyboard. This way, it maintains a lot of the characteristics of a piano, instead of heading into the field of creating what sounds like a more synthetic instrument.

There really isn‚Äôt anything too special here, and I actually sampled way more than I ended up using. Some of the other tracks I‚Äôve posted I‚Äôve been thinking of going back and actually tracking them out and mixing them up a bit, but this one I was super into last week, and now it just kind of falls flat for me.

    <p>No eurorack modules were harmed in the making of this video. The PO-32 (Tonic) makes up the drums, the PO-35 (Voice) is how I got the ‚ÄúNo More Technology‚Äù hook, and‚Ä¶ the lead/bass came from some Eurorack mess. I recorded all of this into Ableton Live for some FX processing. All of this was recorded back in October/November, and I‚Äôve meant to create a finished track.
In the spirit of #Jamuary though, I figured I‚Äôd break out some gear and refine the track a bit more. I‚Äôm really trying to cap myself to about 30-60 minutes of production time this month for each song. This is good in some ways because it‚Äôs forcing me to get ideas down, but it is bad in a few other ways since I‚Äôm really not mixing/mastering anything. Leaving this track with a bit more of a tinny sound than I‚Äôd like, but hey it is what it is.

There was some really cool stuff going on here, and we got some neat amethyst crystals to bring back home with us.
As for the song, nothing too fancy here, just using samples of thumps and bumps from everyday objects. A lot of the magic is just pitching things up and down, using filters‚Ä¶ and then just jamming it out. I‚Äôm going to stick with the PO-33 a bit longer, but a lot of the initial magic playing around with the FX again is a bit gone, it has now gone from being novel to producing some pretty similar sounds to my ear. The device is still fantastic, and it might just be time for me start considering what I am going to move on to for a device to keep going on making tracks.

Funny thing‚Ä¶ I was going to do another house track, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd place it quite in that genre, is it electro house? I don‚Äôt think it is fast enough for Techno‚Ä¶ Somebody who has more refined taste might be able to clarify the music genre for me. I just thought it sounded cool!

    <p>I had intended in jamming out on the MPC today, but I ended up grabbing the PO 33 again‚Ä¶ Producing another small track. Seriously folks, I am surprised at how much big sound can come out of such a small device! This is maybe 30 minutes worth of playing around max.
If you want a laugh, this is maybe seven, max eight, seconds of audio samples. If I actually put the effort in to trim down the wasted space in the drum track, I might be able to get it down to four or five seconds. Honestly, I‚Äôm not bothered by it, but it really goes to show even with the old school hardware and multiple limitations, those older machines really could knock out some bangers without too much effort.
