  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>New Beat Battle up at STBB Forever #694. Was a fun one, and I pulled content from the four tracks. A lot of cool things to sample, and the rules were effectively no hats, and record your own percussion.
I pulled a lot of fun glass bell, horns, strings, piano, etc‚Ä¶ all sounded really good. I just focussed on straight up one shot type sounds, and maybe a few hits with a bit of extra sound on them. I was able to put together quite a few tracks and sequences on the MPC, but honestly a lot of them just didn‚Äôt work together well, so I grabbed the sections I thought worked well enough and strung them together as best I could. So yeah, not exactly proud of this track, but I am trying to keep putting tracks together and retraining my ear for these things.

    <p>This weeks MPC Forums BB 282 is a go! This week‚Äôs challenge is to use an instrumental style track, and to make a trap beat, with a boom bap build up. I‚Äôm not terribly familiar with making trap beats, but I know the genre well enough to give it a go. Besides, trap is what dark vibes, ratchets, whoa/yeah/what shoutouts, and is pretty diverse BPM wise. I guess I forgot the shoutouts on my track though, so at least one mistake. Or was it? No, I forgot to put in some murmurs, shout outs, etc‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going back to update the track.

    <p>It seems like the more teams I work with, the more friends and family I have, the more messaging clients I need to work with. Over the years I have been on many services including iMessage, ICQ, AOL Messenger, Google Chat, WhatsApp, Telegram, IRC, Slack, and many more. There are in fact so many messaging applications, that I am not going to bother to list them all.
Sure, you can load all of the local apps, but anybody who has tried doing this knows that you end up with a mess in your taskbar, and worse, trying to mute messages can be a real chore when you are in a meeting because you may have 10&#43; services that need to be silenced.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My sister has released the book SOMNIUM Beyond the Darkness on Amazon as a kindle book and as a paperback book, which is an excellent read for young adults and adults alike. She‚Äôs been looking to expand out into the audio book space, which makes sense to me!
She had been looking into some voice actors who could read the book. When I heard the audio quality of the demo, it was rather poor. We were hoping that it was just a quick demo, but it suffered from a lot of background noise. My sister passed on links to the voice actor, and the demo‚Äôs she had on her website were great. After I gave my sister a few questions to ask and suggestions for contract negotiations, unfortunately it fell through. We suspect that the voice actor recorded her website demo at a professional studio, and likely recorded the demo she produced for my sister at home. Total bummer, but it‚Äôs better to both live and learn, and get through these miss steps early is what I always say.

    <p>Well I rushed my MPC Forums beat battle submission, and ended up deciding to post a track to STBB Forever this time. Not sure that I‚Äôll dive deep into the STBB community and beat battles or not, but it‚Äôs fun to find some other communities and see what may or may not stick with you.
For the STBB #693 track, there was a *lot* of content to parse through, and there was a lot that would absolutely trip up on a submission to YouTube or Soundcloud. So, who knows how long my submission will last, but it is posted for now. The rules were pretty simple, use something from every track, no snares on 2 or 4, and something about being able to used instruments, but no sampled melodic content. I decided to just use all of the content just from the tracks, that‚Äôs been most of my style lately, and it makes it more of a fun challenge to see what you can squeeze out.

    <p>Boy, I thought I had posted this track a while ago‚Ä¶ heck I made it nearly a year ago, but here it is.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-sounds-of-the-reliquary
I put this track together in about an hour, and it was recorded on the Teenage Engineering OP-1 in conjunction with a Bastl Instruments Micro Granny. I spent a lot of time working out sounds to get it fairly noisy, and making it sound like it had some dark, odd vocal sounding components. The Micro Granny provided a lot of the ground work for those sounds, and I then spent some time to find string instruments on the OP-1 and played them at various tape speeds to get a more stretched out sound.
