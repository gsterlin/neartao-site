Picture comes courtesy of a sunset in Aruba from a couple years back. Took the family to go see the island, and we all had a blast. Heck even got my wife into the ocean for a little bit, despite her being completely afraid to hop into water!
To get the notes I played around with Orb Composer a bit in order to come up with note progressions for Arp/Bass/Chord/Melody‚Ä¶ The key is Ab, Major scale with a chord progression of i-iv-vii-II, or Abmb7/Eb, Dbm/Ab, Gbmb7, and Bbb/Fb. I tried to use the MPC Live Performance Pads to operate in the correct scale‚Ä¶ maybe it worked? I didn‚Äôt play out too much live so it isn‚Äôt exactly like it probably mattered much.

This has been a lot of back to back to back tracks for me, and I am kind of looking forward to the month ending so I can get into a different musical head space. This was just a straight up Expansion Pack kit that I loaded up, and then added a bit more to it with some samples from my brand spanking new Waldorf Iridium. I was more into just playing with the Iridium than making a track, but figured I needed to get moving and actually put something together.

The intent for this track was to put some content together in Reason and then make some create patterns that changed chord structures throughout the song.

    <p>Was struggling to pull anything together for day 26. I started a bunch of tracks but nothing really grabbed me. Must be a downer from all the excitement from Christmas. *shrug*
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/a-grave-decision
I felt like I was just pulling things together randomly‚Ä¶ and then when I‚Äôd start to track out different sections nothing felt like it felt like it worked together. Heck, I removed half of this track because it just didn‚Äôt sit in place correctly and the transitions were quite jarring. It is possible that I am just getting tired of making a track a day, but I think it‚Äôs just the mood.

    <p>There weren‚Äôt any other entries, so I figured what the heck and put together a track.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action
The sample itself was pretty basic, so I figured I would work on chopping it up and just finding a drum kit to play to it. I wanted to focus as much as possible on keeping the original audio track playing throughout the track without it sounding too repetitive, this meant making variations to work through, and seeing what worked. Ultimately I wanted some of the shorter chops to play longer through this process, so a quick detune of 6 semitones had me pretty well sorted so that I didn‚Äôt have any gaps of silence.

This is another track that I tried to go for a more minimal sound, and it was made up of only three loops. I know the track itself is not very complex or technical, but I worked on making up for it by making a few variations of each loop to get some variety in the flips. Given that I am still doing a new track a day, and time has been at a premium, this gave me a bit more time to be picky on the loops that I chose to work with in order to put the track together.

I put this track together from just three samples‚Ä¶ a drum break‚Ä¶ an acoustic bass‚Ä¶ and a piano melody. Nothing too fancy, but I wanted to spend the time today making different patterns from the different samples and then mixing it up and seeing how it came together.
I‚Äôm not exactly stoked by the track itself, but it does feel like it is worth taking the time to make a few change ups this way, even if I‚Äôm limited to doing a track a day. Honestly, it wasn‚Äôt too much more work, and I think where the results worked‚Ä¶ well they did work out well. It‚Äôs just that I need to make the time to do it. Normally for these daily tracks I have been trying to just get one 4 or 8 bar chunk sounding ‚Äújust right‚Äù, but then I end up trying to make it sound interesting by dropping sections, building, etc‚Ä¶

The picture comes courtesy of a trip to Munich. Not so much a tourist type of city, but there‚Äôs a lot to see there. I think that particular shot came from a train ride that I took with my family to go check out the Olympic Stadium out there. It was interesting to see, but kind of sad at the same time to see something that had so much funding and investment put into it that ended up not being kept up and maintained as much as you‚Äôd hope. I suspect that a lot of the Olympic areas around the world are like this, and I suppose when things get back to normal I will have to travel around to check out more for myself.
