    <p>This post is curtesy of the MPC Forums Beat Battle 281!
So I was going to do a DnB track, but unfortunately pk1 posted one of his own tracks on accident. Sadly, no DnB track dropping for now. Here‚Äôs the snippet of what I was messing around with in case you are interested. You can see, Amy is super thrilled for being in the picture!

Fortunately, I wasn‚Äôt more than an hour into sampling and chopping, and had just started to sample a few instrument sounds. Check out the Rezo Bass for the MPC X/Live/One, if you‚Äôre looking for a bass sound that didn‚Äôt even make it into the DnB track. I had literally just sampled it and saw the ‚Äúoops‚Äù post. Anyways‚Ä¶ somewhat of a lost opportunity as I had wanted to do a DnB track for a change, but also figured I had invested enough time and energy and wanted to go a different direction with the next track.

    <p>There are at least as many workflows as there are people doing it. There are certainly wrong ways to approach it, but don‚Äôt let anybody fool you by saying they know ‚Äúthe one way‚Äù.
For a beat battle, the two most important things are to familiarize yourself with the rules, and familiarize yourself with the samples. These two things will likely be the most important for setting your direction and where you want to experiment or challenge yourself, and knowing where you can safely stick to basics.

I‚Äôm going to lead off with ‚Äúif it sounds good, it is good‚Äù. That doesn‚Äôt mean that everybody else will like it, but it can be important to go with your gut. While chopping with a GUI sure is handy, it also can lead to some very ‚Äòsame‚Äô chops. So if a chop that is early or late works for you, does not mean it is wrong.

    <p>The beat battle is active for another couple days, if you‚Äôre interested check it out at BB 280. The rules are pretty simple, just use the two samples provided, and no outside content. Also, a 1:30 time cap, so no run on pieces.
The image comes from a picture I took while on a work trip to Bangalore. Which reminds me‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/bb-280-funky-dream
I spent a couple of hours and created a lot of different sequences to play with. Some of the components vibed better than others together. Parts were either too high energy or too low energy, so I ended up taking the components I liked the most and putting them together into something that I felt was as coherent as possible without killing a lot of time on this.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was looking around for something completely different, and happened to stumble upon this Reddit thread [DOWNLOAD] OP-1 Patches (op1_14203) which was posted to the OP-1 sub forum for users that wanted access to the older patches provided by the older OP-1 firmware. The direct link is currently still available to a google drive folder that somebody was nice enough too put together here.
For me, this is an interesting find, because it isn‚Äôt always easy to find the older firmware for devices, and often when you do find the older firmware it is missing a lot of features and functionality to the point of not wanting to downgrade. What is great about these patches is that they are drop in replacements for the OP-1 and gives you some view into what the older firmware was able to do with sampling and the sound engines, without the need to downgrade your device.

I can also hit the Calories goal with about twenty minutes of running, but that has been a bit rougher for me. My allergies kick in, and I have work induced asthma.

If you‚Äôre interested in seeing some of the discussion and submissions check out the MPC Forums BB 279 Thread. There‚Äôs definitely a lot of good content there, and some really great flips.
My approach has been to just spend 60-90 minutes on each battle, so instead of trying to get a full track or perfect mix, just go for speed of getting something workable and putting it together quickly. This battle was no different, and while I‚Äôm not excited for the track exactly, it was fun.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This track started life on the MPC X, and I did everything I could to try and use Clip mode to create loops. How the MPC X handles clips is close to what I need, especially compared to how previous versions handled clips‚Ä¶ but I have to say, it is not quite there.
I‚Äôve got two main problems with how the MPC X handles clips. The first problem is that the looper cannot be used in real time in many instances, because you are forced to take audio off of your inputs (mostly fine) or resampling (not really fine). Resampling means that you‚Äôve got to take a break in your workflow if you want to resample something you are doing live while running other audio. The other problem I hit was that when you export the loop from audio to a sample, when you assign it in clip mode, it does some kind of strange BPM timing‚Ä¶ and this almost never matched what the project I was working on. Although my project was 96bpm, it would just assume what seemed like a random BPM 90% of the time, and with warping on it would sound like hot stretched garbage, even with the Pro Ten warping turned on. This is a big bummer and doesn‚Äôt bode well for using the MPC X as something you could use in a live environment.
