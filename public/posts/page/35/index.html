    <p>For this week, the drop was what‚Ä¶ 300&#43; clips. The rules were to use at least three, and you had to put product placement in your track of at least five seconds.

For the STBB Beat Battle #696 Funky-Disco-Trip I tore threw a bunch of loops that I found interesting to work with, and decided to use Ableton Live this time to put it together. I haven‚Äôt used Ableton Live a whole lot in the last few years, but I still mostly know my way around, and it‚Äôs like riding a bicycle right, just hop back on?

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Well I just (hopefully) wrapped up the audio processing for my sister‚Äôs book. Since the last post, I probably could have done three other posts about the series of events that happened. Suffice it to say that there are some competing formats, tools, and audiobook sites that aren‚Äôt exactly in alignment.
So‚Ä¶ I had gotten my sister‚Äôs book all processed, converted to .mp3 format, and she was quite happy with the sound. Unfortunately she doesn‚Äôt really understand audio processing or audio file formats, so this kicked off a chain of unfortunate re-exports. Each process and export job probably took me 60-90 minutes‚Ä¶ and since I had only ever expected to do this twice, I never automated the job. Each time I ended up processing the files, it was ‚Äújust one more change‚Äù which had me shrug, and go off and do a whole bunch of clicking to re-process the files again. After time five, you‚Äôd think I would have learned my lesson. Which I did, but maybe not the one you‚Äôd think.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So a few days back I posted about picking up an Akai MPC 500 on Reverb‚Ä¶ and it was absolutely a mess inside. In case you didn‚Äôt see it, I‚Äôll post a picture below, but it was all jacked up. I suspect something heavy was dropped on it, or some other excessive amount of force. Maybe you can help decide?
So yeah, it was busted enough to snap the PCB in several places, and you can see where the metal frame got bent as well. Yesterday I picked up some Krazy Glue in preparation for the attempt for a big fix. I figured that particular glue would likely be the best way to hope to put the PCB back together as it does a really solid job bonding plastics. On the negative side, I am always getting this stuff stuck to my fingers and all over the place‚Ä¶ so I wasn‚Äôt exact thrilled to be working with it again.

    <p>I hit a 53 day move/stand/exercise streak, and I am not going to lie to you, mentally it has not gotten too much easier than it has been. Meaning, I am still doing my best to get up and move around, but there continue to be days where I do question how important this is to me. I guess it is more philosophical in some ways, because yeah, I know this is important for my health, but a big question that keeps coming up for me is why. Why do I want or need to be healthier? Do I need to loose weight? How much better shape do I need to be in? These questions are certainly all normal, and I do have the answers to them for myself, but I‚Äôm finding it important to remind myself more often.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>https://soundcloud.com/neartao/stbb-695-running-forever
This track comes courtesy of STBB Forever BB #695, there were two tracks to chop up. The rules were effectively to chop whatever, use your own drums, no external instruments, and you needed to drop a change up in the track. I‚Äôm interested to see what others do this week.
Similar to the MPC BB this week, I was really crunched for time to work on this. This time however I decided I would just do the track in the PO-33, and make it a quick flip. So I loaded the tracks into the MPC, but didn‚Äôt even bother chopping on the MPC, I just shuffled the starting point around the tracks and sampled in what ever I wanted to start or stop, and was able to get four or five interesting chops pretty quickly from the first track. For the second track, I just sampled roughly a loop, and let the auto chopper do it‚Äôs magic, or horrible destruction.
