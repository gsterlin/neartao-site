This track‚Ä¶ well the rule was to use the sample‚Ä¶ and do something outside your comfort zone. I rarely put any kind of silence in my track, so I wanted to force myself to have breaks throughout the song, but have it sound as natural as possible.
Most of the track was put together on the MPC Live mk2, but I also did load the finished track into Ableton Live for some further poking and prodding. The middle section that kind of functions as a drop, and the outro were both done in Ableton. I figured it was a short enough track, but needed something to mix it up a bit.

    <p>https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb289-long-way-to-go
A bit of a scramble this one‚Ä¶ but had fun listening to the song and picking out the parts I liked. All done on the MPC Live mk2‚Ä¶ only software intervention was to load Fission so I could just cut the track to length and do a quick fade out. I promise :D
This time around I tried to create 3 different main sections, and then worked through drops, buildups and such to get the track together. Then just strung them together in song mode. It was a bit of a hassle because I exploded a few too many tracks in spots, and then from section to section they didn‚Äôt line up‚Ä¶ add to this that I did not name any of the tracks properly, and it made for a bit more confusion trying to create various sections. Worked out pretty quickly though, I‚Äôd say this track came together in two hours max.

I‚Äôm just going to lead with this thought: college students, please continue to get your degrees!
I used to manage a team of roughly fifty employees, and I had plenty of college students and interns. We would frequently extend internships, and occasionally bring interns on as full time employees. Often this was done to help retain talent, but I would always talk to these employees to make sure that they would continue their school.

    <p>I don‚Äôt know about other folks out there, but the way the world has changed over the last few months just seems like another planet. My wife and I are doing everything we can to keep our daughter in as socially normal atmosphere as possible, but we‚Äôre really keeping to ourselves otherwise.
It‚Äôs been weird too, because just as COVID-19 broke out I was starting a new job, getting ready to meet new people, and drive new projects. My job is fully online now, which is a larger change than I anticipated. Previously I was traveling a lot, getting together with people to make sure we were moving products, and overall very highly connected. Now I am keeping people focused in meetings, helping get programs on the rails or stay on the rails,

Apple apologizes to Wordpress, no longer requires free app to add purchases
When I read last week that Apple was removing the Wordpress app from the Apple store I thought things were getting a little strange. The application never had payments in place, and you had to go to the Wordpress site to pay for your subscription. I suspect that given everything going on with Epic and the Fortnight fiasco that Apple is just getting overly sensitive about companies removing their ability to get a 30% cut.

This track comes courtesy of my Eurorack build. I am working on trying to clean up content I have recorded on the 4MS WAV RECORDER, and found this. It was reasonably complete enough that I figured I‚Äôd just post it up as is. There isn‚Äôt anything too fancy going on, but it was fun to put together.
This isn‚Äôt really a finished project, and was something I was more interested in playing around with some ideas for a live performance. It was really just pulling together a bass line, some drums, and a freaked out probably over processed evolving space sound. From there I just used some basic mixing components to evolve some of the sounds by turning knobs.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I‚Äôve been listening to podcasts for a number of years now in the iOS environment. I keep going back to Apple Podcasts every major release or new hardware deployment, but it just never sticks for me. The feature set is absolutely fine as it is, and if there were no other options I would probably stick with it.
Apple Podcasts
I upgraded to a new Mac, and have decided to give the Apple Podcasts app another spin. One thing that jumps out immediately is that it is not sync‚Äôing podcasts across my iOS device and my Mac. Perhaps this is a feature that should work, but I would expect like most other Apple apps that this would be pretty simple to setup. There is an option under preferences to sync between devices, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem to do anything. I suppose I could search for how to do this on the internet, if it is there, it might as well not exist if it is not easy to figure out.
