    <p>Alright folks‚Ä¶ normally I don‚Äôt get into video games on this site, but since Repentance is not going to be supported on Intel based Apple hardware‚Ä¶ well I figured I‚Äôd write up a tutorial to get you going.
For this ‚Äúhow to‚Äù, you‚Äôll need to get Crossover for your Mac. Personally, I bought the $59.95 for one year support. Heck, I used to use this product to play games ten or so years ago, so I‚Äôm a bit familiar with it still. I had lapsed from using it because I had been using Bootcamp so much, but I have subsequently stopped upgrading my Parallels VM, and honestly, games run pretty poorly through Virtual Machines, and I didn‚Äôt want to be booting into bootcamp to play games.

    <p>This is day four track‚Ä¶ and another one working with the SP 303 to sample and mess with the FX a bit. What did I do exactly? Uh‚Ä¶ not sure‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/breathing-in
Another track of sampling into the SP 303, and running effects and stuff, and then sampling back into the MPC to make a finished drum kit.
I played everything out with the Track Mute again‚Ä¶ but this time used TC. It helped a bit‚Ä¶ at least making it more obvious where problems were. Would try again hah.

    <p>Day 3‚Ä¶ This track I mostly wanted to mess around with the Boss SP 303 to understand the sampling workflow a bit better.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/where-my-boys
The picture is Isaac from the game ‚ÄúThe Binding of Isaac‚Äù. Cool kid.
To put this together I drove samples into the SP 303 C and D banks. They are much faster to sample on, even though it is still quite slow compared to modern standards. It was a pretty good way to test out the repair job that I did for the pads as well, since I was bouncing around a lot of the buttons, minus the pattern stuff. I‚Äôm not sure how much I care to bother with pattern sequencing here when I can just resample everything into the MPC. So I filled up all 16 smart media sample slots between bank C and D‚Ä¶ The samples came in between a mix of raw, and sometimes with some effects already running, and I did end up adding effects on the way out back into the MPC as well to make a drum kit.

    <p>Had 30 minutes‚Ä¶ and knocked out a second quick track for day two. What am I thinking?! I could have saved this for tomorrow!
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/get-on-the-freight-train
There isn‚Äôt much to this‚Ä¶ just roped in some different expansion sounds‚Ä¶ the synth and the bass from the MPC Juno sound pack. The drums‚Ä¶ I forget. If I remember I will look it up.
Really just knocked this out by laying out the drums and the chords in the drum kit really quick, and then loading up the two synth sounds. I setup pad performer notes at Gb Major just to knock it all out hopefully in tune, and then put it through the ringer of expanding the track to 64 bars and then track muting.

    <p>I bought a Boss SP 303, which was obviously used. It showed up, and it smells like either a musty arcade, or somebody‚Äôs basement. Clearly the SP has been in storage for a *long* time, and I‚Äôm not sure that the scent is going away. The description for the SP 303 was Very Good condition, but when it arrived some of the pads were shot. Most importantly, the record pad just wouldn‚Äôt work at all.

    <p>This track is better than yesterday‚Ä¶ though still needs some tweaking.

The picture is just some flowers that my wife bought‚Ä¶ Calla Lilies if you‚Äôre interested. We‚Äôre trying to get more flowers in the house and make it feel more like home.
As for the track, this is straight up another MPC Live track. I grabbed a handful of samples and just got to chopping. I know I could have done a better job getting some of the slices together, but I tried to do it by ear as much as possible, and hey, I continue to approve of the slightly wonky and janky sound. So it was a lot of using the threshold chop mode to get the party started, and then adjusting the start/end points a bit by ear. I know for sure that a few of the mistakes in the chops came from forgetting to turn off the linked slices afterwards, but I haven‚Äôt really been doing much for tracks over the last TWO months, which has gotten me quite a bit out of practice. Only done a few hit or miss beat battles in between, and I hadn‚Äôt even bothered to write up a post about them. Well, I do need to get myself more focussed again

I put this Drum Kit together with the intent of making it quite noisy in mind.¬†It‚Äôs a bit more of a harsh industrial kind of sound, so you‚Äôre likely going to want to apply effects to tame these sounds a bit.¬†A lot of what makes it rough was running the sounds through sample frequency reduction and a pretty heavy level of compression.¬†This gives the tails of the sounds an especially unnatural nature.
