    <p>First track for #jamcember and trying to do a track a day.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-peaceful-day
Just a lofi track to relax to. Yeah I know it‚Äôs kind of noisy‚Ä¶ as the lofi folks like? A lot of vinyl, tape, and other random clicks and clacks. All done on the MPC Live mk2. I‚Äôll probably keep all of the tracks done through the MPC Live mk2 this month just to really dig into it a bit more and see if 2.9 has either weird workflow bugs I trip over or things that get me to think about working on the tracks differently inside the box.

NT - S950 v4 Download
The big thing I learned this time around was that from the Sampler menu, if you select a mono source and set the sampling to mono‚Ä¶ well I didn‚Äôt have to use Fission to covert the samples to mono. That saved some headaches for sure!
Overall notes for the auto sampling:
\* 430 Mono samples
\* Should play from C-2 to G8
\* Sampled C0 to C5 in most cases, with a stride of 4
\* Generally 16 samples per program
\* Only one Sample Layer at velocity of 127

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A conversation started on MPC Forums about the MPC &amp; S900/950 Routing Question. We got into details about how the S900/S950 worked, which then lead into S900/S950 samples sounding more full on the S1000 and later. I ended up taking a stab at sampling both white noise and a drum break on the S950 with a bandwidth of 3000 and 19200, and then playing the notes across the key group to get some samples together. Below is the project and recordings from the S950 and S1000 for your own listening.

    <p>I‚Äôm back at it for another round of sampling off of my trusty Akai S950‚Ä¶ still working like a champ. Before getting into the details, here‚Äôs the link.
NT - S950 v3 Download
Good news is that I am getting faster at sampling, but the bad news is that I made a mistake on a few of the programs and called them S95 instead of S950. This wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal since the .xpm files are text editable since they are in a human readable format, but it was a bit of a chore to rename all of the samples, edit the file to do a search and replace of S95 to S950, and then hope everything worked out okay. Still, it wasn‚Äôt so bad, and I have gotten some more samples together for your enjoyment.

    <p>Just another quick painting that I did. I was testing out how well the paper would handle darker paint, and I‚Äôm still going to say with the pencil board behind the page, it is hardly relevant and doesn‚Äôt really impact my ability or distract me from writing on the next page.
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that controlling the amount of water you put on the page is important, but I haven‚Äôt noticed the color lifting off of the page and rubbing on older pages yet.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Pictured above is our family dog Abbey, our very own German Shepherd. I want to say my parents got her when I was around twelve or fourteen, and this picture was taken when I was probably twenty or twenty two at my parent‚Äôs house. Abbey was our second dog, Sonya had the honor of being our first dog and was a black lab.
Abbey was a great dog, though she could be a bit of a worry wart, and was definitely over protective, but she could also get quite scared. She was a kennel pup, and sadly when we got her, her tail had been broken in three places. We‚Äôd often get asked if she was mixed because her tail tended to curl upwards a lot, where as most German Shepherd‚Äôs have much straighter tails. For this reason, I wouldn‚Äôt get a dog that came from a kennel ever again. You just don‚Äôt know what the breeder, delivery person, or the pet store may have done to the animal, and it gives too much room for everybody to point their fingers at each other.

NT - S950 v2 Download
Similar to a few days ago, this is MPC X/Live/One formatted for the program file, but the samples are 44.1k/16-bit mono, so you can load them into most MPCs and samplers. I was definitely a bit faster at flying through the low end key group and setting it to record notes down to C0, though I still forgot to check and change C5‚Ä¶ in about half the cases this resulted in one less sample for the program.

This track came together last night from just patching and trying to see what I could do after not really messing with Eurorack for a few weeks. My wife and I have been ramping up to keep the house cleaned for showings, and it was just something that I haven‚Äôt given myself time to do.

    <p>I spent about six hours yesterday recording off samples from my Akai S950, and auto sampling them into my MPC Live mk2. Near the end I think I was starting to get cross eyed. Anyway, if you‚Äôre interested, I have posted the samples below, and then will get into the details after the break.

This is MPC X/Live/One formatted‚Ä¶ though the samples are 44.1k/16-bit mono, so should load into plenty of samplers. I considered converting this stack into a MPC Expansion, but gave up on the app for now. Maybe later, when I figure out the steps to create previews‚Ä¶ and apparently it wants sequences for each program *shrug*. I watched a few videos on YouTube, and read Tutor‚Äôs Complete Guide to MPC Expansion Packs but got the impression that you might need to use the MPC Software in order to do some of these things more effectively.

    <p>Since I have my travel water color kit sitting on my desk, and I ended up doodling a bit during some meetings, I figured I‚Äôd do a little mixed media and see how well the paper would handle it.
To start, I just did a pretty simple design sketch with a mechanical pencil (a Kuru Toga for those who want to keep track). This was not anything too fancy, and I tried to keep the impression light so that when I got to coloring the water wouldn‚Äôt pool too much. Of course, since I had already written on the other side of the page, this was bound to be a little suspect, but I wanted to try. Regardless, with the writing board behind the page, it worked well enough to get a rough outline down on paper. I suspect there is room to try some embossing techniques in the future, but for now I‚Äôll just keep it in mind.
