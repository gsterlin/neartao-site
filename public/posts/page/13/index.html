    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Just knocking something out fairly quickly over lunch for day.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace
The picture is from years ago‚Ä¶ Aruba I think? I‚Äôll have to look it up and see if I can figure it out.
To make the track, I did another fake 4 bar loop to turn into a vaporwave track. So quite similar process to the last few days. The big difference here is *way* more automation, filtering, and for the first half of the song I used the Air Halfspeed plugin to make the vaporwave component feel slower. The whole track was going much much slower than I usually go for, so I really just tried to lock in what felt like a leaned way back vibe and go with it.

The picture is some really amazing graffiti from Hawaii. some really talented artists out there! Wish I had time to see more of what was going on out there, but what I saw was definitely solid.

    <p>Well today I felt like messing around with making a vaporwave styled song‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav
Another picture courtesy of my trip to Hawaii. Really gorgeous island, and could definitely just hang out at the beach for days.
To make vaporwave you usually take some old 80‚Äôs music, find a loop, time stretch it way down, and then drop a beat on top of it‚Ä¶ maybe some filtering, reverb, or other fx to boot, but the idea is super easy to do.

    <p>Expecting today to be a bit crazy, and I woke up early. So got the dogs out, and decided to get to business. Dogs out at 6:00am, fed, and in front of the MPC by 6:10am. Looking at the clock now and it is 6:52am. So factoring for upload time and stuff‚Ä¶ I guess a 35 minute track from start to finish?
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/way-up
The picture comes from my trip with my family to Hawaii. Was taking an early morning walk with my wife and saw the bird up in the tree. Not sure what kind of bird it is, but it was definitely striking!

The picture is from Hawaii, and I had gotten my wife a coconut to drink. She loves it‚Ä¶ I keep trying to drink coconut water, but frankly it is not for me. I‚Äôm sure it is healthy, but just not my thing. My wife can drink it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner though!

The picture is another one from the walk. Just some train tracks that I had to walk over, and look like a good time to snap a quick picture.
More importantly though, what I had for lunch. Chicken Tikka Masala, and boy did it hit the spot! Sure it was store bought, packaged, and needed to be reheated, but it is what I had available at the time, or I could have had some fajita leftovers, but I think I am saving those for tonight.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This track started while I was out visiting my sister and her family last week. Was just sitting on a chair and knocking out some sounds to see what would stick.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/hungers
The picture is from a library, the venting looked interesting so a snapped a picture. Ran it through a Ps Camera filter (elements?) just to see how it would look.
This track is a mix of loops I grabbed, and loading up some synths and using pad performer to try and get some other sounds in tune with the loops I was grabbing. Not rocket science, but the way that the loops were reported as a key in the MPC Sample Edit section made it a bit awkward to figure a few things out. Mostly because the MPC refuses to acknowledge flats, so it always thinks everything is sharp. Not a big deal per se, but it can mean that you‚Äôve got to think through what key/note range it thinks content is in and then break it down into what you are actually going to play. Sure if you do it right it all matches up regardless if you are sharp or flat, but it can mean that the way you think about some of the notes is just off, if that makes sense?
