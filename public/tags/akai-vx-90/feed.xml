      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just testing a few things on the VX90/S950 combo setup and figured I would record off a few key groups to see how things were sounding. Below are the files if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in checking them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that Cherry Crush was the first key group that I recorded yesterday after getting everything setup and working again. I recorded a sample into the S950 and then worked on tweaking the filter and resonance to see what kind of sweet spots I could find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent a few hours messing around with the configuration, and trying to get everything to work. It is not exactly straight forward, and I had to dig through a lot of old posts and try and understand what exactly different sources were trying to tell me. I found a few that indicated that it should work polyphonically, but didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly describe the steps to get there, or said things a little too generically. I can say, I now have it all working (yeah!), and will go through how to get this setup step by step, where you might hit a few problems, suggestions to test out issues. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I kicked off a discussion over on MPC Forums &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=42&amp;amp;t=210454&#34;&gt;Akai VX 90&lt;/a&gt;. There was some interest in the LPF/Resonance, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just do a quick video. Definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t illustrate the entire scope of the resonance, but just to give a quick idea of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/NMUUltOa6gY&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/NMUUltOa6gY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just showing off the Tauntek Custom Firmware I recently installed, and access to using CCs to control parameters. In particular I setup two Q-Links to control both the low pass filter and resonance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking off and on for an Akai VX 90, and finally found one. Probably paid too much, but wanted to hook one up to my Akai S950, so there will be that, once I get the cable in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last couple of days just playing around with it, reading the manual, and trying to get my brain around how it works. As you can see from the featured image, the interface is a bit sparse, and not a whole lot of direction as to what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
