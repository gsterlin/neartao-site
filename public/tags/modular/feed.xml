      <title>On the Edge</title>

&lt;p&gt;This track comes courtesy of my Eurorack build. I am working on trying to clean up content I have recorded on the 4MS WAV RECORDER, and found this. It was reasonably complete enough that I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just post it up as is. There isn&amp;rsquo;t anything too fancy going on, but it was fun to put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a finished project, and was something I was more interested in playing around with some ideas for a live performance. It was really just pulling together a bass line, some drums, and a freaked out probably over processed evolving space sound. From there I just used some basic mixing components to evolve some of the sounds by turning knobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first patch I put together on the new build out of my Eurorack. Just a short video messing around with the patch&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Track - Endless Space</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/07/20/track-endless-space/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first track I put together using my new euro rack modular setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/endless-space&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/endless-space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to remember this patch&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll post a picture and kind of describe it as best as I can. It was more a test to see how cable routing goes, and if I need longer cables. Turns out so far it isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad, and there&amp;rsquo;s a little something for everybody in every corner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Euro Racking</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/07/19/euro-racking/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Erik and sent him this picture so he knew I had the case in hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3b1989f0-f4b8-439f-9186-2a59c4b9548f%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to strong arm the case up to my desk, and upon turning it on I can tell you the noise from the power was very very high! I was concerned that it was a dirty power supply, but figured that once I had racked everything the sound might go down&amp;hellip; sometimes power supplies make a lot of noise when they don&amp;rsquo;t have a load on them, or too much of a load. You never know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Modular Case Has Arrived</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I got the notice from UPS that the case was on it&amp;rsquo;s way, and it will be here today! Super excited to get my hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few pictures of the package and opening up the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3b1989f0-f4b8-439f-9186-2a59c4b9548f%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UPS delivery person said this was one of the best packaged shipments he has ever seen, and I have to agree. We flipped it (shhhh&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t tell Erik Needham). This is a beefy case, and I have to say, it looks like some pretty good quality wood for the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Erik Needham Modular Case</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ordered a case from Erik Needham back in January. I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting patiently for six months or so now I think. It&amp;rsquo;s been a balance of waiting to get the modules together I wanted, and trying to get more room by selling off gear I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use any more. If you want to check him out go to his Instagram &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/needhamwoodworks/&#34;&gt;Needham Woodworks&lt;/a&gt; or look him up on &lt;a href=&#34;https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=Needham%20woodworks&#34;&gt;Reverb&lt;/a&gt;. Definitely some great stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
