      <description>&lt;p&gt;Messing around with the bass side of things, and liked how this was sounding. I tried to sample the space that had the most interesting sound to it, and going into the high end it rather tails off around C3 to C4&amp;hellip; so don&amp;rsquo;t expect to use this as a lead by and stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a bit of time adjusting the ADSR, it was on the edge of popping on the attack, and I adjusted the release so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just abruptly stop. These changes were made in the program, so you can undo them if you want to keep the character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was kind of hunting around for a bit of an accordion sound, and figured this was close enough to a synthetic sound as I was going to make with the modular case today. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to the NT-Modular-Wet Lazers key group I put together, just a few patch changes for how the filter operates and which wave table I was using out of the Disting EX Plus Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a super simple patch I put together on the modular, simple because this smaller case only has a handful of modules in it. While it isn&amp;rsquo;t complete yet, I wanted to test out and see how well it did or did not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-last-breath.zip&#34;&gt;NT-Modular-Last Breath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-last-breath.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound is basically an oscillator running on the Disting EX in dual mode, so that I could also get an envelope generator, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have that in this case at the moment. The oscillator is fed into the VCA, which is modulated by an LFO running positive on the Left channel, and running negative on the Right channel, this creates a kind of panning tremolo effect. I think routed that audio output into another pair of VCAs so that I could control the volume by the envelope. From there, the audio is running into a stereo filter to augment the sound a bit and give it some resonance to adjust the sound a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
