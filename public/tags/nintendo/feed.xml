      <description>&lt;p&gt;Articles and videos that hit my feed and some thoughts on them. Just my opinions&amp;hellip; take it or leave it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/apple-apologizes-to-wordpress-no-longer-requires-free-app-to-add-purchases/&#34;&gt;Apple apologizes to Wordpress, no longer requires free app to add purchases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read last week that Apple was removing the Wordpress app from the Apple store I thought things were getting a little strange. The application never had payments in place, and you had to go to the Wordpress site to pay for your subscription. I suspect that given everything going on with Epic and the Fortnight fiasco that Apple is just getting overly sensitive about companies removing their ability to get a 30% cut.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
