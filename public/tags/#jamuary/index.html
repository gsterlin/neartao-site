    <p>I‚Äôm not really happy with this, but I also had a bit of a gap for #Jamuary. Guess it was too much to think I‚Äôd put something together every day. On the other hand, it is freeing to have just taken a few takes, and going for the best of them so that I can move on.
There really isn‚Äôt anything too special here, and I actually sampled way more than I ended up using. Some of the other tracks I‚Äôve posted I‚Äôve been thinking of going back and actually tracking them out and mixing them up a bit, but this one I was super into last week, and now it just kind of falls flat for me.

    <p>The image is courtesy of a road trip I did with my family from the East Coast out to Montana. On the way back we stopped at an amethyst mine, and I got some really cool pictures of some older beat up vehicles. There was some really cool stuff going on here, and we got some neat amethyst crystals to bring back home with us.
As for the song, nothing too fancy here, just using samples of thumps and bumps from everyday objects. A lot of the magic is just pitching things up and down, using filters‚Ä¶ and then just jamming it out. I‚Äôm going to stick with the PO-33 a bit longer, but a lot of the initial magic playing around with the FX again is a bit gone, it has now gone from being novel to producing some pretty similar sounds to my ear. The device is still fantastic, and it might just be time for me start considering what I am going to move on to for a device to keep going on making tracks.

    <p>The image is from my daughter. While we took a trip out to Montana she kept borrowing my phone to take strange pictures with odd filters. This is one of many featuring one of our dogs. It looked intense enough to be a good track image. Enjoy the image of my dog slowly zooming in while listening to a electro song plays!
Funny thing‚Ä¶ I was going to do another house track, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd place it quite in that genre, is it electro house? I don‚Äôt think it is fast enough for Techno‚Ä¶ Somebody who has more refined taste might be able to clarify the music genre for me. I just thought it sounded cool!

    <p>I used some Washi tape to label the write and record on the PO-33 on the case. I keep pushing the wrong one and deleting samples or otherwise overwriting stuff I don‚Äôt want to. I‚Äôm just not keeping the two clear in my mind. Also, it doesn‚Äôt help that the write button with the white dot reminds me of a record button‚Ä¶ but yeah, it is still me! :D
Apparently I‚Äôm really sticking with one or two drum loops, some vocals chopped up by and amateur (well the PO-33), an instrument sound, and maybe a bass sound. I‚Äôm going to have to do something different to push myself to not fall into a track. And‚Ä¶ This track fell out of the sky! Well rather, I just recorded off some more samples to see what I could do to push the PO-33 a bit more. By pushing, I mostly mean doing even more FX and changing the FX up more.

    <p>I had intended in jamming out on the MPC today, but I ended up grabbing the PO 33 again‚Ä¶ Producing another small track. Seriously folks, I am surprised at how much big sound can come out of such a small device! This is maybe 30 minutes worth of playing around max.
If you want a laugh, this is maybe seven, max eight, seconds of audio samples. If I actually put the effort in to trim down the wasted space in the drum track, I might be able to get it down to four or five seconds. Honestly, I‚Äôm not bothered by it, but it really goes to show even with the old school hardware and multiple limitations, those older machines really could knock out some bangers without too much effort.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Although I‚Äôve been happily selling off gear, I‚Äôve still got the Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators I picked up a while back. I was feeling like putting something together super fast, and while I was planning on recording off samples, creating drum programs, all that fun stuff‚Ä¶ I also didn‚Äôt want to spend too much time.
So‚Ä¶ I reached for my trusty PO-33 and decided to sample in some beats. Originally I was going to use the internal microphone, but while this is sometimes interesting, there was a bit too much background noise (ie, the kid wouldn‚Äôt stop singing Frozen songs). I had to use the line in, which honestly does tend to have a fuller sound, the microphone is fine, but often it does lack the bottom end a bit.

Yeah yeah‚Ä¶ I usually do my own chopping and sampling‚Ä¶ but I was more interested in just putting something together quick and checking out how hot the output levels are on the MPC X, and how badly distorted it would get going through the Chase Bliss pedals.
