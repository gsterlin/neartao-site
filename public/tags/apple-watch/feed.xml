      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here is a bit of a quandary for me. About a week and a half ago I hit a 59 day streak for closing all of the rings on the Apple Watch, and then it stopped. In the last two weeks I have not been closing all of my rings despite my exercise right being frequently over flowing. What is going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time thinking about this and if I should be upset with myself or not. I had been really looking to get healthier over the last few months, and boy do I feel like I have in some ways disappointed myself by not closing all of the rings. As with many things in life though, I had to spend some time considering why this may not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hit twenty four days of closing the workout rings on my Apple Watch in a row yesterday. The rings are Move - 740 calories, Exercise - 30 minutes, and Stand - 12 hours. I&amp;rsquo;ve found a roughly two to three mile walk will get me there for the day, and takes me about 30-40 minutes to complete. I can also hit the Calories goal with about twenty minutes of running, but that has been a bit rougher for me. My allergies kick in, and I have work induced asthma. I&amp;rsquo;ll work through it better in the future, but as it has warmed up and gotten more humid outside, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really wanted to run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
