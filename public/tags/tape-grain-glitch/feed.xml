      <title>Couple of SP-404 mk2 tracks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still having fun with the mk2! I find it to occupy a nice space between my other gear, it&amp;rsquo;s not as powerful as the MPC Live as a sampler or for creating patterns, but there&amp;rsquo;s also something refreshing about being limited. Also, the product line has been quite focussed on resampling in the past, and the 404 mk2 really isn&amp;rsquo;t different from that regard. To get the most out of it you&amp;rsquo;re encouraged to sample from your line/instrument/mic inputs and use fx to sculpt a sound from there. Yeah yeah&amp;hellip; super natural for people who have been there, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing some people saying they are not into resampling&amp;hellip; and what the SP to be something it probably never will be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More or less took a couple week musical break. Two things happened. First, I wanted to do some more case modifications to my make noise case… and having to take it apart, drill and Dremel… it was a several day investment of time for getting it all squared away, measure everything to get it to fit, get it back together… and just hope that I haven&amp;rsquo;t overloaded the power supply!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Isolation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/11/13/track-isolation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure why, but this feels like it is in the space of the &amp;lsquo;peak sound&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve been working towards with this setup. Still a bit noisy and still a bit awkward to control sometimes, but hands on, a bit glitchy, and something that can sustain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/t1mUOeepWNw&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/t1mUOeepWNw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track started the day as something happier, but as it wore on, I just kind of went into my own space of wishing, longing, dreaming, but all at a distance with some strange energy. Not the track I had set off to put together but it might be the track I needed to put together right now. I do like this, and hope that others get something out of it too, but I guess I just had poured a lot more self reflective vibes here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MPC Forums Beat Battle #321 - How You Flop</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/11/13/mpc-forums-beat-battle-321-how-you-flop/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3546</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, shout out to MPC Forums, and check out the Beat Battle #321 thread if you want to see what others are up to at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&#34;&gt;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/CEdn4CfaI6A&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/CEdn4CfaI6A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this track was about 90 minutes to put together? A lot of the time was spent chopping, and then finding different lines. I gave a stab at an initial 8 bar sequence and figured it was okay enough. I know I normally go at this as one long sequence, but I really want the sound to change over the course of the track, so although each 8 bar sequence could more or less stand on it&amp;rsquo;s own, I felt it would be fun to make a few different once and then use song mode (for once) to chain them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Starlight By The Beach</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/11/06/track-starlight-by-the-beach/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did a thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3P5SMy9Ul-w&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/3P5SMy9Ul-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the track didn&amp;rsquo;t use the eurorack for much, but I did a bit of processing through it before recording a bunch of audio into the SPs, then chopping that content up on the MPC to actually play it. Given all the noise it became a bit of a hassle to prepare all of the samples on the MPC because it just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the start/end with threshold very well, but it felt like it was worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3504</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a somewhat simple lunch break track&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/OvOWOcHukWI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/OvOWOcHukWI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track was so many takes to get to this somewhat still janky state. At least fifteen, and the worst is that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t setup the input/recorder properly to actually capture any takes. I had a good one or two in there, and then realized I was recording off of the microphone and not off of the Zoom H6 inputs. Doh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also fighting with some CV outputs from the MPC to gates into the Pam&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; because&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m rolling my eyes at myself, I had not recorded off the triggers at all. So it was constantly loosing sync, the resets were doing what I wanted, but well&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can get the idea. I really need to create a template for my setup so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep remembering all this twiddly bits that can cause me a problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a long day, day off for my daughter, and some arguments. She&amp;rsquo;s not happy that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for her to eat at Starbucks, and I&amp;rsquo;m not happy to be treated as a piggy bank. So put this together to just decompress and relax a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/&lt;/a&gt;_l0eLSWeR4g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just used the same setup/patch in the eurorack as yesterday, but I did leave the guitar track (on accident) going straight to the outputs. Honestly, it was probably the right choice, but well&amp;hellip; it is what it is :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - The Streets Watch Back</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/11/01/track-the-streets-watch-back/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 23:41:35 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3478</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Been trying to work out some issues, and make tracks louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/vDzTg5h65RI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/vDzTg5h65RI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track I tried to push into using the morphagene for a bit of ambient noise to bring in and out to an okay effect. Probably something that is better to automate with an envelope so have it swell in over time, but that&amp;rsquo;ll mean considering a rewatching of how everything is setup, which I suppose I am due for anyways, since over the last month I have had some grumbles about how some of the gates, attenuators, and other things have been configured. I can effectively get 4 discrete signal paths out to the Befaco STMix, and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve tried applying a path like MPC Live -&amp;gt; Morphagene -&amp;gt; Sqwak Dirty -&amp;gt; Mimeophon -&amp;gt; Data Bender -&amp;gt; STMix, and while this works, it has left Beads out, which I&amp;rsquo;ve then added in by peeling off the signal from Sqwak Dirty -&amp;gt; Beads -&amp;gt; STMix. There is some value in having two discrete paths for the same voice, but I think I need to consider what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get, and which types of sounds or effects make the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A day track this time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HbXDBwXj53k&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/HbXDBwXj53k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded off some samples onto the SP-202, slowed them down, and tried to get a bit of the LoFi 1 crunch to get a bit into the Vaporwave space, but this is definitely not 80&amp;rsquo;s inspired or reminiscent… so I guess it is something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resampled the loops back into the MPC so I could line them up better and get everything into sync, then added drums. There&amp;rsquo;s a touch of Mimeophon on the instruments, and the Instruments/Bass/Drums are getting some Data Bender treatment. I suspect the Bass being so dang low is a mixing problem… especially since I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to mix the track. Oops… will save it off and see if it is a track to come back to in the future to refine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scurried off and used loop mode to record me noodling around on the Triton Studio until I found something that felt decent. I ended up unplugging a bunch of patch cables because there was some CV in place that was messing with me, so ended up with about 10 different but similar recordings, but had a lot of accidental drops and other problems. Was trying to hit something a bit more fun and wacky for today&amp;hellip; and I guess I got there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just trying to see how much I could squeeze a track down&amp;hellip; with four tracks and pushing the Mimeophon and Data Bender harder than I usually do&amp;hellip; got some interesting results for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/80IZwgB8wvw&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/80IZwgB8wvw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly excited by what came out for the first track so decided to give it another try and see what I could do with the 20 minutes before I have to go pick up my daughter&amp;hellip; like this a bit more :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day and not as much time to dedicate to the track as I&amp;rsquo;d like&amp;hellip; still mostly happy with how it came out though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/24Y1qDwL7X4&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/24Y1qDwL7X4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More of a laid back/chill track for today. With of course, buffers galore, glitch effects, etc&amp;hellip; this required over a dozen practice runs because I was trying to get a bit more movement and hands on with the track, but was causing some incredibly disorienting pitch shifts and swells. The practice helped a lot though, and I think I ended up making a lot less mistakes in this track than some of the previous ones I&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just something a little jazzy, a little funky&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track started out life back in August at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house while visiting, and was a subset of a jam session that I did with my brother in law. Sadly, no guitar or other instrument takes were had, so I had to add in some electric piano, pads, and bells to fill the track out a bit, and give it a bit of a jazzier feel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was initially just testing out my reconfigured setup&amp;hellip; but figured I&amp;rsquo;d run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/L3tj2vKJC&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/L3tj2vKJC&lt;/a&gt;_c&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m abandoning the configuration I am working on for getting multiple tracks together, just that I was getting some more concepts together :D Nothing technically I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before, but this is all tracks that I played out, tweaked notes, velocity and all that fun stuff, to try and get a sound I was going for. Hopefully the levels are working better&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Finally getting a vision of some sounds/ideas to put together into a big ol&amp;rsquo; mix and mash of tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/G7u&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/G7u&lt;/a&gt;_6dGFtv4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been so focussed on trying to just get a track done, or only having a half hour that I kind of just forgot about my original goal of putting a set of tracks together. I certainly played around with it a lot, a month or two ago, but I have been more focussing on just doing a track a day for the last couple of months that it passed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got myself some credits on NeuralBlender&amp;hellip; and actually started buying some art&amp;hellip; whaaaaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to spend some time today trying to think about a way to use the Morphagene as a sample player of some sort&amp;hellip; and got a couple samples going&amp;hellip; didn&amp;rsquo;t go for anything crazy or off the rails&amp;hellip; but they both got some more action today than usual&amp;hellip; so instead of just using them as a passthrough for the MPC outputs, they got some real sounds going&amp;hellip; haha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; here it is for today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track gave me some problems. Mostly Total Recall&amp;hellip; I just realized that it triggers or rather changes parameters on the down event of a clock or gate&amp;hellip; and Pam&amp;rsquo;s was sending a gate for 50% of a beat, meaning that the change was happening on 1.3 instead of 1.1 of a bar. Doh! This was giving me all kinds of problems, and I&amp;rsquo;ll need to rethink how I&amp;rsquo;m using Total Recall. The quick fix was to change the gate width from 50% down to 1%, but I still feel like this leaves some margin for error. Back to the drawing board a bit for how I&amp;rsquo;m using Total recall. Surprisingly, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even noticed this until today&amp;hellip; I guess the more ambient sounds just weren&amp;rsquo;t making me notice it so much, but the arp today&amp;hellip; woah boy&amp;hellip; was it messing with my timing&amp;hellip; took a few tries before I got to the &amp;ldquo;is it me, or is it you&amp;rdquo; thought&amp;hellip; I guess at least it wasn&amp;rsquo;t me this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yah&amp;hellip; sometimes we just need to simplify!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could&amp;rsquo;ve made this into a longer track, but yeah&amp;hellip; I think keeping it short and simple definitely kept it moving and interesting. At least I feel like I got more out of it than I would have otherwise trying to layer a ton of sounds in and then having a big mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively I made the four tracks on the MPC to begin with, and spent the time making sure I was happy with the eight bars first, pretty similar to what I did yesterday. From there I just starting assigning tracks to different outputs on the MPC, and then driving them through different effects in eurorack, and then, as usual, I chased it with the SP 202 and SP 303 at the tail end to just add the dust, grit, and grunge for the song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3403</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track was fun, but I also had a lot more time today to be picky with sound selection, make some various sections, and then add in eurorack for some extra spice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/frcc&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/frcc&lt;/a&gt;_5iL7yo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track started from the much cleaner track recorded on soundcloud that I did pretty much everything on the MPC, and then just ran it through and end chain of SP-202 and SP-303. I actually made a few other tracks that didn&amp;rsquo;t make the cut because they just clashed a bit too much with everything going on here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decided to keep it simple today&amp;hellip; really simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all is going on? The picture comes from Neural Blender again&amp;hellip; still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its&amp;rsquo; range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly +4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela&amp;rsquo;s New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; today felt pretty good&amp;hellip; but did like&amp;hellip; five&amp;hellip; maybe six takes&amp;hellip; was getting a bit of a jam going and then would make a mistake&amp;hellip; this take came together pretty well though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/JGcR613&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/JGcR613&lt;/a&gt;_21U&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my pretty traditional setup I&amp;rsquo;ve been going for lately, but with the SP 202 and SP 303 added to the end of the chain&amp;hellip; oh and I&amp;rsquo;ve added in the Zoom H6 at the end of chain to function a bit as a mixer/audio router&amp;hellip; the RCA to 1/4&amp;quot; adaptors are what is causing me the biggest headache in this setup&amp;hellip; but it is kind of nice having the 202 do LPF duties at the end of the chain, and then the Vinyl FX from the 303 to do some compression and wow/flutter duties&amp;hellip; and a hint of vinyl noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still in a kind of meh&amp;hellip; for making music day&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; still having fun and got a chance to mess with Neural Blender some more. So that&amp;rsquo;s nice :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the track&amp;hellip; well I tried to use some automation on Morphagene&amp;hellip; to limited success&amp;hellip; and just ended up dumping the drums and Vox from the MPC out to Sqwak Dirty and Data Bender&amp;hellip; so uhm&amp;hellip; I dunno&amp;hellip; just a simple thing&amp;hellip; but I kind of feel like I need to start from a bit more of a square one and figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m actually interested in doing again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Still hitting a problem recording audio&amp;hellip; but I think it is me&amp;hellip; as the two tracks don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the same. I recorded several takes, but somehow the last recording didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to match between the YouTube video and the soundcloud audio&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m doing something wrong. Probably too tired to do everything correctly&amp;hellip; doh!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3351</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So uhm&amp;hellip; apparently I forgot how to operate my gear&amp;hellip; clearly what happens when I take a break for a single day and use the pocket operators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/T7jdc69J9G8&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/T7jdc69J9G8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this track I disconnected the entire hot mess from a couple days ago&amp;hellip; and just really went to focus on basics. I decided I wanted to try recording in a few chords into the Morphagene and then using Pam&amp;rsquo;s New Workout on a random LFO to send a change to which splice was selected&amp;hellip; and it works pretty nicely except for one problem. The Morphagene doesn&amp;rsquo;t switch to the next sound until partway through playing&amp;hellip; so either I need to work out clocking issues, or change config.txt settings or&amp;hellip; something. It works fine for this track more or less, but required some playing around and bumbling around to get some rhythm that sounded like it could work with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah&amp;hellip; not really sure what to make of this&amp;hellip; other than way too many patch cables&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a serious mess. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what I have done any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image is just my work pc&amp;hellip; with a mysterious rocket flying into it? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; I hardly could muster the energy to pull this together. Guess it&amp;rsquo;s just one of those brained out lame tracks&amp;hellip; that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really figure out what to do with it&amp;hellip; and everything I did made it worse. Good thing it was maybe 20 minutes of time invested, instead of a lot of work that would make me sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alright putting this track together was a pain&amp;hellip; I had too many different elements going on, and out of the *nine* recording attempts&amp;hellip; only one was halfway decent. My biggest problem is that about a third of what I put together just didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh with the other parts of the track. I&amp;rsquo;d keep recording and trying to decide which way to go with it, but it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening. The synth lines didn&amp;rsquo;t gel, the Lofi arps didn&amp;rsquo;t gel, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to come together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For this track I built it up off of 16 clips from an expansion, made sure to use each one&amp;hellip; and then did a track explode on the MPC, set the pads 1-8 to output to 5/6 (and thus on the bottom chain of FX of the eurorack), and set pads 9-16 to output to 3/4 (the top chain of FX of the eurorack).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly me just using track mutes from here, and then turning knobs on the eurorack to jam out, cut up, glitch, and otherwise morph and destroy the various elements of the track that are playing. A few places feel like they didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work, but hey&amp;hellip; gotta try right?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
