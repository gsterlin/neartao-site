    <p>Just something a little jazzy, a little funky‚Ä¶
https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA
The track started out life back in August at my sister‚Äôs house while visiting, and was a subset of a jam session that I did with my brother in law. Sadly, no guitar or other instrument takes were had, so I had to add in some electric piano, pads, and bells to fill the track out a bit, and give it a bit of a jazzier feel.

This doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm abandoning the configuration I am working on for getting multiple tracks together, just that I was getting some more concepts together :D Nothing technically I haven‚Äôt done before, but this is all tracks that I played out, tweaked notes, velocity and all that fun stuff, to try and get a sound I was going for.

I have been so focussed on trying to just get a track done, or only having a half hour that I kind of just forgot about my original goal of putting a set of tracks together. I certainly played around with it a lot, a month or two ago, but I have been more focussing on just doing a track a day for the last couple of months that it passed.

Yesterday I got myself some credits on NeuralBlender‚Ä¶ and actually started buying some art‚Ä¶ whaaaaat.
Decided to spend some time today trying to think about a way to use the Morphagene as a sample player of some sort‚Ä¶ and got a couple samples going‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt go for anything crazy or off the rails‚Ä¶ but they both got some more action today than usual‚Ä¶ so instead of just using them as a passthrough for the MPC outputs, they got some real sounds going‚Ä¶ haha.

    <p>Well‚Ä¶ here it is for today
https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI
The track gave me some problems. Mostly Total Recall‚Ä¶ I just realized that it triggers or rather changes parameters on the down event of a clock or gate‚Ä¶ and Pam‚Äôs was sending a gate for 50% of a beat, meaning that the change was happening on 1.3 instead of 1.1 of a bar. Doh! This was giving me all kinds of problems, and I‚Äôll need to rethink how I‚Äôm using Total Recall. The quick fix was to change the gate width from 50% down to 1%, but I still feel like this leaves some margin for error. Back to the drawing board a bit for how I‚Äôm using Total recall. Surprisingly, I hadn‚Äôt even noticed this until today‚Ä¶ I guess the more ambient sounds just weren‚Äôt making me notice it so much, but the arp today‚Ä¶ woah boy‚Ä¶ was it messing with my timing‚Ä¶ took a few tries before I got to the ‚Äúis it me, or is it you‚Äù thought‚Ä¶ I guess at least it wasn‚Äôt me this time.

    <p>Yah‚Ä¶ sometimes we just need to simplify!
https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ
Could‚Äôve made this into a longer track, but yeah‚Ä¶ I think keeping it short and simple definitely kept it moving and interesting. At least I feel like I got more out of it than I would have otherwise trying to layer a ton of sounds in and then having a big mess.
Effectively I made the four tracks on the MPC to begin with, and spent the time making sure I was happy with the eight bars first, pretty similar to what I did yesterday. From there I just starting assigning tracks to different outputs on the MPC, and then driving them through different effects in eurorack, and then, as usual, I chased it with the SP 202 and SP 303 at the tail end to just add the dust, grit, and grunge for the song.

This track started from the much cleaner track recorded on soundcloud that I did pretty much everything on the MPC, and then just ran it through and end chain of SP-202 and SP-303. I actually made a few other tracks that didn‚Äôt make the cut because they just clashed a bit too much with everything going on here.

What all is going on? The picture comes from Neural Blender again‚Ä¶ still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it‚Äôs definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.
Well‚Ä¶ the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its‚Äô range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly &#43;4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela‚Äôs New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.

This is my pretty traditional setup I‚Äôve been going for lately, but with the SP 202 and SP 303 added to the end of the chain‚Ä¶ oh and I‚Äôve added in the Zoom H6 at the end of chain to function a bit as a mixer/audio router‚Ä¶ the RCA to 1/4&#34; adaptors are what is causing me the biggest headache in this setup‚Ä¶ but it is kind of nice having the 202 do LPF duties at the end of the chain, and then the Vinyl FX from the 303 to do some compression and wow/flutter duties‚Ä¶ and a hint of vinyl noise.
