    <p>And now for something completely different.
Today I just decided to do what I could with the pocket operators I have on hand‚Ä¶ PO-32, PO-33, PO-35‚Ä¶ and see what would come from it. I‚Äôll definitely get back to the MPC Live and Eurorack, but just needed a change of pace for a bit. Probably will do another PO track or two for the time being and go for something a bit longer, I suspect.

The short answer to the question is NO, you cannot have multiple audio interfaces hooked up to your iPad. At least this is probably not going to work the way that you want. I was hoping to use the iPad to route audio around between the iPad, OP-Z, and OP-1, but alas, it‚Äôs not quite meant to be.
AUM In the video I show what happens when you try to do this in AUM, and it is a complete bust, whatever the iPad recognized as the last audio device is the one, and only one, that it will recognize. End of Story.

    <p>Over at MPC Forums Danoc was asking a bit about the OP-1‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs my response.
It‚Äôs the Teenage Engineering OP-1. It has taken on the status of being an overpriced (released in 2011‚Äôish at about $799 USD, today sells new for $1299 USD which was the latest price hike in 2019) piece of hipster music production hardware. It‚Äôs an interesting piece of gear, but isn‚Äôt exactly user friendly‚Ä¶ if you want to push yourself to think outside of the box, it has that in spades, but for me it is not a serious piece of music gear in today‚Äôs space.

This is a track I have been working on for about a week on the PO-33. All the sampling and mixing was done within the little box. I continue to like this little device because it really forces you to think about a potentially crippling amount of sampling time and a very real four note polyphony limit. Some of the previous tracks I have done really ran into the polyphony wall, and it doesn‚Äôt exactly drop notes the way I would expect at least.

This track comes courtesy of STBB Forever BB #695, there were two tracks to chop up. The rules were effectively to chop whatever, use your own drums, no external instruments, and you needed to drop a change up in the track. I‚Äôm interested to see what others do this week.
Similar to the MPC BB this week, I was really crunched for time to work on this. This time however I decided I would just do the track in the PO-33, and make it a quick flip. So I loaded the tracks into the MPC, but didn‚Äôt even bother chopping on the MPC, I just shuffled the starting point around the tracks and sampled in what ever I wanted to start or stop, and was able to get four or five interesting chops pretty quickly from the first track. For the second track, I just sampled roughly a loop, and let the auto chopper do it‚Äôs magic, or horrible destruction.

    <p>Boy, I thought I had posted this track a while ago‚Ä¶ heck I made it nearly a year ago, but here it is.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-sounds-of-the-reliquary
I put this track together in about an hour, and it was recorded on the Teenage Engineering OP-1 in conjunction with a Bastl Instruments Micro Granny. I spent a lot of time working out sounds to get it fairly noisy, and making it sound like it had some dark, odd vocal sounding components. The Micro Granny provided a lot of the ground work for those sounds, and I then spent some time to find string instruments on the OP-1 and played them at various tape speeds to get a more stretched out sound.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>I was looking around for something completely different, and happened to stumble upon this Reddit thread [DOWNLOAD] OP-1 Patches (op1_14203) which was posted to the OP-1 sub forum for users that wanted access to the older patches provided by the older OP-1 firmware. The direct link is currently still available to a google drive folder that somebody was nice enough too put together here.
For me, this is an interesting find, because it isn‚Äôt always easy to find the older firmware for devices, and often when you do find the older firmware it is missing a lot of features and functionality to the point of not wanting to downgrade. What is great about these patches is that they are drop in replacements for the OP-1 and gives you some view into what the older firmware was able to do with sampling and the sound engines, without the need to downgrade your device.

There really isn‚Äôt anything too special here, and I actually sampled way more than I ended up using. Some of the other tracks I‚Äôve posted I‚Äôve been thinking of going back and actually tracking them out and mixing them up a bit, but this one I was super into last week, and now it just kind of falls flat for me.
