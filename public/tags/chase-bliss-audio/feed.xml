      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is it time to start the count down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well this one was a bit more of a pain to get started. I have had a mild headache most of the day and just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to put any energy into making a track&amp;hellip; however the show must go on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is courtesy of my basement&amp;hellip; and the dead spider is courtesy of the glass apparently trapping it in. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what made me think of the picture or the title for the track, but somehow they are now linked in my brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mixing it up a bit for the twenty second track&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of a trip to Munich. Not so much a tourist type of city, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to see there. I think that particular shot came from a train ride that I took with my family to go check out the Olympic Stadium out there. It was interesting to see, but kind of sad at the same time to see something that had so much funding and investment put into it that ended up not being kept up and maintained as much as you&amp;rsquo;d hope. I suspect that a lot of the Olympic areas around the world are like this, and I suppose when things get back to normal I will have to travel around to check out more for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track has been a bit of a labor of love&amp;hellip; haha. I decided to jump into the next challenge for Electro Funk, and was listening to a lot of tracks from the era. If you want to check out the main post on MPC Forums for the Electro Funk Challenge, well go on over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=200241&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Been a lot of discussion again, and I think it was the third page I dropped a number of YouTube videos, most of which are in the right style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s challenge on &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=711&#34;&gt;STBB Forever is #697 - Claude Debussy&lt;/a&gt;. Rules were pretty open, go find your own Claude sounds. I ended up listening to a *lot* of this Youtube track&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t listen to the whole thing, but I did consume a lot of it. There is a lot of great music in here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dropping this track&amp;hellip; now&amp;hellip; folks in the MPC Forums have seen this in my sig for a while now&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve just been super lazy in posting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride I happened to see while I was grabbing ice cream and had to take a picture. While I don&amp;rsquo;t want to old one of these older vehicles, I can appreciate them when I see them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was done almost entirely on the MPC X for sequencing sections and building it out into a song&amp;hellip; in song mode. Haha!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LoFi Buttery Piano - Akai MPC X Program</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/03/08/lofi-buttery-piano-akai-mpc-x-program/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start by explaining the patch a bit, and how I got here&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life started off on the Akai S950, using piano multi samples from G1 through C4, every sixth note&amp;hellip; My goal was to get some of that S950 12-bit grit and artifacts, but still keep it relatively free of the crazy stretching artifacts you can get by just sampling a single note and stretching it across the entire keyboard. This way, it maintains a lot of the characteristics of a piano, instead of heading into the field of creating what sounds like a more synthetic instrument.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who&#39;s Home - PO-33 #Jamuary</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/01/21/whos-home-po-33-jamuary/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not really happy with this, but I also had a bit of a gap for #Jamuary. Guess it was too much to think I&amp;rsquo;d put something together every day. On the other hand, it is freeing to have just taken a few takes, and going for the best of them so that I can move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really isn&amp;rsquo;t anything too special here, and I actually sampled way more than I ended up using. Some of the other tracks I&amp;rsquo;ve posted I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking of going back and actually tracking them out and mixing them up a bit, but this one I was super into last week, and now it just kind of falls flat for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Its my Jam - PO-33 Track</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image is courtesy of a road trip I did with my family from the East Coast out to Montana. On the way back we stopped at an amethyst mine, and I got some really cool pictures of some older beat up vehicles. There was some really cool stuff going on here, and we got some neat amethyst crystals to bring back home with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the song, nothing too fancy here, just using samples of thumps and bumps from everyday objects. A lot of the magic is just pitching things up and down, using filters&amp;hellip; and then just jamming it out. I&amp;rsquo;m going to stick with the PO-33 a bit longer, but a lot of the initial magic playing around with the FX again is a bit gone, it has now gone from being novel to producing some pretty similar sounds to my ear. The device is still fantastic, and it might just be time for me start considering what I am going to move on to for a device to keep going on making tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The image comes courtesy of a business trip to Bangalore. The pool with the blue lights looked amazing so I had to take a picture. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to keep an eye out for more of these eye catching images&amp;hellip; and maybe I can do a better job getting a &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; photo on my phone&amp;hellip; or a video&amp;hellip; so I can work out some neat video tricks versus just having a video of me clicking on guitar pedals and such.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just messing around with the Akai MPC X, I tapped out a beat using the Rawcutz sample pack, and for those that care the sound kit is &amp;ldquo;HipHop-Kit-RC Ace Kit 95.xmp&amp;rdquo;. Yeah yeah&amp;hellip; I usually do my own chopping and sampling&amp;hellip; but I was more interested in just putting something together quick and checking out how hot the output levels are on the MPC X, and how badly distorted it would get going through the Chase Bliss pedals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, here&amp;rsquo;s a video I recorded for the festivities today. A single sleigh bell sound, processed through a bunch of Chase Bliss Audio effects and pedals. This is not a song, think of it more as an FX test.&lt;/p&gt;
