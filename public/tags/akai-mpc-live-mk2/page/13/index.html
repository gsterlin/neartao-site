The picture is from a few years back, when Amy was more of a spring chicken. she‚Äôs still quite an active dog, but she definitely prefers to be laying down on a lap, or being held. Still curious to explore and see new things, but not quite so bold as she once was.

The picture is from a long time ago, my daughter and I were under a blanket with a flashlight trying to make scary faces. Good times, and nobody got scared. She was a fun kid. I was trying to figure out a good place to use the picture, and this one seemed to be a good fit.

    <p>Setting up Midi over Bluetooth and the MPC is dead simple, and I figured I‚Äôd take some time to make a quick video and write this up for everybody else to enjoy.

Introduction
I just recorded a video to show how to setup Bluetooth Midi between an Akai MPC Live/X/One and an iPad. I have done these steps with an iPhone as well, and suspect that it would work just fine with plenty of other devices that support Midi over Bluetooth as well.

    <p>The second 264kb challenge track I put together and dropped over at MPC Forums, and a bit more focussed on an experimental sound.

The picture is of a cigar box style guitar my dad made for me for my birthday last year. It‚Äôs mostly stayed in my closet, though once in a while I have taken it out. There‚Äôs something a bit messed up with it though, and it honestly needs some TLC. I‚Äôm not quite sure what the problem is with it, so that‚Äôs a bit of a problem for me to fix it. I‚Äôll probably need to bring it back to him and see if he can figure out what needs to be done to fix it. If I recall‚Ä¶ the pickups are a bit wonky and not ping up one of the strings very well‚Ä¶ though it could be something else. What does this have to do with the track? Nothing‚Ä¶ just thought it was a kind of need picture.

My first entry is a chip tune track, and I tried to use effects that would make this sound like an old 8-bit/16-bit track. It is not authentic, but I was trying to impart some of the low end grit. If you want to check out what I threw together for the track the project files are available here.

The picture is of the fire pit that we built‚Ä¶ going to miss it when we move to the new house, but we‚Äôll create another one :D
The track came together pretty quickly while I was watching my daughter play the sims, make a character of me‚Ä¶ who she promptly made broke, and then I guess I was then homeless. She had my avatar doing a lot of weird things. It makes me wonder what my daughter thinks of me sometimes.

The picture is from my daughter playing piano for a recital. It was‚Ä¶ three years ago now? She‚Äôs been learning to play piano for five or six years now, and knows far more about playing music than I do. She can sight read, has very good finger posture, and knows her way around the keys. On the other hand, I try and talk to her about sampling, beat making, song structure, and these are things she doesn‚Äôt know how to do. Occasionally we will talk and bounce ideas off of each other, but she‚Äôs not into creating songs, just more interested in reproducing them right now.

So not really a garage‚Ä¶ but boy was that toy for my daughter busted. I ended up upgrading it with a bunch of additions like a tiny and working tv inside, fixed up the doorbell, it was a pretty rocking little house. When we got it though, it was broken as heck‚Ä¶
Kind of like the song I put together. I was kind of thinking about going for a House track‚Ä¶ and as you listen to it you can tell I kind of split between an acid baseline, and some other sounds in there‚Ä¶ and never really committed to a garage track, or a UK track‚Ä¶ or anything else. It straddles the line, but not in a good way. I suspect I need to burn this track with fire‚Ä¶ but today I had been working on two or three other tracks to started out with‚Ä¶ and just never was happy with anything. I guess not every day can be decent or above.
