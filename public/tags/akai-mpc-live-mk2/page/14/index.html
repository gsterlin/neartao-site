The picture is of my daughter‚Äôs wand she had when she was in ballet as a tiny tyke. The instructors used the wands as a reward for the younger kids doing a good job and paying attention during the class, and then they could prance around with the wands. Rewards for doing what you want, is a good way to keep kids focussed, but this can work for anybody :D

That‚Äôs my dad‚Äôs Jeep, hooked up to the back of the RV and ready to go. That trip was an experience, but I would absolutely do it again given the chance.

Sometime I should go through the pictures and see if there is anything neat to write about.

The picture is from a trip to Puerto Rico‚Ä¶ probably around twenty years ago now. Just a quick snap that I took while driving by the beach. The water down there is amazing!
Putting the track together, I figured I‚Äôd work on something a bit more experimental, so not quite so traditional drums and sounds, and just see how it came together. Overall, I am relatively happy with it, but the mixing seems off. I spent some time trying to adjust the levels, but I think there‚Äôs some EQ and filtering that would need to be done to really make the track pop. I did my best by ear, but I got stuck in a few areas where having some visuals to go with the EQ to see where harmonics are probably would have helped be a bit more precise, instead of just using a low pass and high pass filter to just remove sounds completely.

The pictures is of a family friend‚Äôs dog, that just looked super evil for the day. I might have to play with the picture again, because it could really turn into something special. Not today though‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs just about time to start preparing for tomorrow!
This track is just a straight up noisy DnB track‚Ä¶ I initially wasn‚Äôt intending to get so gritty but everything just kind of fell into place that way. I had a ton more FX I had layered in, but had a bit of a hard time figuring out if you can automate turning FX on and off (turns out as far as I can tell you cannot).

The painting is from when I used to record art lessons and post them online‚Ä¶ I think I did about 100 episodes, under the title ‚ÄúPainting in Five‚Äù. This particular one was showing how to paint out a rough sketch, and I‚Äôm quite certain it was based off of the lion from the MCM Grand. At any rate, the idea was to just show people how to quickly get some things down without thinking too much about whether it was good or bad. And now‚Ä¶ about twenty years later, I am doing a track a day just to get myself to put something down. Maybe I should bring back the ‚ÄúIn Five‚Äù concept in the blog? I‚Äôve been thinking about it, but haven‚Äôt committed to anything yet.

The picture comes courtesy of my back yard. Well I sold my house, so technically now it is the new owner‚Äôs back yard, but I am currently still living here.

About a month to a month and a half to go‚Ä¶ and believe me, I am ready‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about time to get my damn music studio back together so I can get access to sounds that I want when I want them. That said, it‚Äôs been quite nice to be working with a greatly reduced set of sound sources‚Ä¶ so it hasn‚Äôt been an issue by any stretch of the imagination.

    <p>Over at MPC Forums Monstre Sensible kicked off a thread Export Song. A key question asked what happens to audio over the 0db mark, and if this could be considered headroom. I was ready with the ‚Äúhere is the manual page‚Äù to describe the behavior, but Akai didn‚Äôt actually document what happens in the manual. So‚Ä¶ time to get some scientific experiments started.
In response I setup a little test, using a normalized single cycle loop, and hooked it up to my Eurorack oscilloscope so I could see what was happening. In theory, this should determine if we have digital distortion in the MPC Live/X/One on the Channel Volume or not.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/high-and-tight
The picture is from a game of air hockey with my daughter from years ago. Something we used to do a lot at the local kid casino‚Ä¶ but she is too old for that now :D.
The track was made using drums from MPC Tutor‚Äôs latest drum kit‚Ä¶ The Underground Crates. If you‚Äôre looking for some new drums definitely check it out. I‚Äôm digging this MPC Expansion so far, and can see it having a lot of mileage. The rest of the track is just a chopped up bass and chopped up guitar sample. Nothing too exciting‚Ä¶ and I had a vocal track with it, but it was just too much. I ended up just going for keeping this track simple and chilled out today‚Ä¶ so it isn‚Äôt exactly special‚Ä¶ but I really liked how chilled out and fun it sounded.
