    <p>Day 17‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/fears-for-tears
The picture is from a painting I did years ago‚Ä¶ I think I gave it to my mom? *shrug*‚Ä¶ somebody probably still has it.
This track came together pretty fast. I started with a pretty basic drum beat and bass line, and tweaked the FX, pitch, etc‚Ä¶ a bit to get a bit more of an interesting sound. It wasn‚Äôt long before I added in the piano. This is just a chopped up loop, and I decided to do something different, and work on make a 32 bar playing of the chops, instead of doing my usual 4 or 8 bar play through and then working with the loops. I‚Äôm going to have to consider this in the future, as it was both fun to see different ways I could utilize the sample, but I also got a few interesting places I normally wouldn‚Äôt get to.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/almost-there
The picture is a chocolate cake we had for Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶ really good‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure my wife picked it up at Whole Foods‚Ä¶ if I remember correctly.
For the track it‚Äôs another mix of chops and synths‚Ä¶ and auto sampling‚Ä¶ and mistakes. I spent a lot of time looking for sounds that I felt would work together, so this track feels pretty good. Normally I‚Äôd upload the auto sampled synth‚Ä¶ but it has echo in it‚Ä¶ making me have to record every single note for the group, and then this makes it hard to use outside of a 96bpm standpoint‚Ä¶ as well‚Ä¶ it also only works for the notes I sampled which‚Ä¶ put it in the rather not so useful category for a general standpoint. I may try and find a good delay/reverb match to make it into a generic MPC patch‚Ä¶ but for now it just felt kind of strange to upload something so rigid and honestly kind of single purpose.

The picture‚Ä¶ I believe is from Disney, from the animal park resort. I am pretty sure I mentioned how much my daughter loved that trip. We had a blast, and it was great to see all of the different animals.
This track is a mix of chops, and synths. I started by chopping up a break, and then moved on to finding some guitar sounds to fill out some of what I thought was going to be a lead and the bass‚Ä¶ but well‚Ä¶ the bass sound was decidedly not inspiring‚Ä¶ and I kind of drowned up the guitar sound in a lot of this track with some of the synths (whoops). So not the end of the world, and something that could be patched up with some mixing, but my intent here was to work on keeping things in key, or as in key as I could without totally knowing what I was doing.

I tried to slow the track down here‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I kind of like the sound of it, but you can tell just listening to it I drifted off into some mental space that wasn‚Äôt so focussed on the track‚Ä¶ I suspect this is what happens for creating a new track a day for a month and a half. I wanted to like it, and I wanted to feel like I was being productive, but instead I felt like I was just slamming content together. Worse, this was me just chopping loops up‚Ä¶ which normally I dig, but I think being the first day back to work, I just kind of got ‚Äòmeh‚Äô about it.

Boy, the picture is from about four years ago‚Ä¶ Amy is looking impressively squinty‚Ä¶ might have been from the flash, I don‚Äôt really recall. Looked like a goofy enough picture to work with for today‚Äôs track though. She‚Äôs watching you!
Today I took my own personal advice from yesterday and only applied transposes to the track level, and not the sequence level of the song. I figured that way I‚Äôm not having drums hop all over the place and can have some more control over what is going on. It was a little bit more work, but it wasn‚Äôt insurmountable.

    <p>The track was named as such‚Ä¶ because I threw my hands up in desperation. *not* a good track, but I did learn something‚Ä¶ but first
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-time-here-is-done
So the picture comes courtesy of the dang thing that the MPC Live did to twist up my song.
Yeah, above is the drum track‚Ä¶ but let me explain how I got there‚Ä¶
I figured I would play around with transpose on sequence mode‚Ä¶ just do a pattern of I/IV/I/V‚Ä¶ (or no semitone offset, &#43;4 semitone offset, no semitone offset, &#43;5 semitone offset). With me so far? I basically just copied my main sequence twice, second sequence I put a &#43;4 semitone transpose on the sequence, and for the third sequence I put a &#43;5 semitone transpose on the sequence. I then went to song mode and just did the pattern Seq 1, Seq 2, Seq 3, Seq 4‚Ä¶ and then converted the whole thing back into a sequence.
