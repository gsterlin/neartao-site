As I said in the previous post, this track had to come together quite quickly‚Ä¶ and this is maybe at best an hour worth of work. I scrambled to get it together and then added some decorative vocals and a baseline to boot.
In all seriousness this track is a bit over compressed, you can hear it especially when the hi hats slam into the available headroom. I guess I got too carried away with everything in the short amount of time‚Ä¶ but I got what I got :D.

Alrighty then! So for this track, I started it and finished it in about 30 minutes. I just didn‚Äôt have much time to hit the deadline yesterday‚Ä¶ and figured I‚Äôd just cut to the chase for the throw down. To pull this together I just grabbed a four bar section that I liked the sound of, chopped it, pitched it down, and then got to business laying out a track. I then searched through drums and kits to piece together something for drums, a little fx, and some bass that was halfway decent.

Well this was a super quick flip of the MPC Forums BB #284, and when I say quick I mean I did this in about 30 minutes. This was entirely an exercise to force myself to get it completed, since I am kind of running out of time, and I wanted to see where I could go if I just unrealistically restricted myself. My primary goal was to make sure that I wanted to limit the number of takes I did to put this together, and figure out how to glue it together in a way that it would sound coherent.

This track came together pretty quickly. Maybe two hours of goofing around on the MPC Live mk2 at most. The core of it started with me patching on my modular system, and seeing what tones I could create, and then sync‚Äôing that to the MPC Live mk2 over CV‚Ä¶ well technically gate signals. You can see from the picture that this is honestly not a terribly complicated patch.
This patch is what is making that sometimes bass, sometimes bloopy sound in the track. Effectively Tempi is being clocked by the MPC Live mk2 gate out, which is then clocking the Wogglebug, Brains, and a strike on the RxMx. DPO is doing the oscillator duties today, and being run into the FxDF 6db slope that is then patched into RxMx. In turn, RxMx is being filtered by the QPAS which is then going to the output. Of note, Pressure Points/Brains is being used to modulate the 1v/octave to generate the change in tones, as well as the left !! on QPAS, and the Wogglebug step modulation is driving the QPAS filter changes. I went this way to create a fair mix of ‚Äúin control‚Äù and somewhat random modulation, which I recorded in as an eight bar loop in the MPC Live mk2 Looper.

This is a track I have been working on for about a week on the PO-33. All the sampling and mixing was done within the little box. I continue to like this little device because it really forces you to think about a potentially crippling amount of sampling time and a very real four note polyphony limit. Some of the previous tracks I have done really ran into the polyphony wall, and it doesn‚Äôt exactly drop notes the way I would expect at least.

This picture comes courtesy of Photoshop Camera on the iPhone with one of the goofy filters. I was out RV‚Äôing with my family and my parents for a couple of days over the weekend‚Ä¶ which held me up from having time to pull together more of a track. I was split on the track this week, and was messing around on Sunday afternoon on the MPC, and the yesterday I flipped to try to put a track together on the PO-33.

    <p>Well I rushed my MPC Forums beat battle submission, and ended up deciding to post a track to STBB Forever this time. Not sure that I‚Äôll dive deep into the STBB community and beat battles or not, but it‚Äôs fun to find some other communities and see what may or may not stick with you.
For the STBB #693 track, there was a *lot* of content to parse through, and there was a lot that would absolutely trip up on a submission to YouTube or Soundcloud. So, who knows how long my submission will last, but it is posted for now. The rules were pretty simple, use something from every track, no snares on 2 or 4, and something about being able to used instruments, but no sampled melodic content. I decided to just use all of the content just from the tracks, that‚Äôs been most of my style lately, and it makes it more of a fun challenge to see what you can squeeze out.

So I was going to do a DnB track, but unfortunately pk1 posted one of his own tracks on accident. Sadly, no DnB track dropping for now. Here‚Äôs the snippet of what I was messing around with in case you are interested. You can see, Amy is super thrilled for being in the picture!

Fortunately, I wasn‚Äôt more than an hour into sampling and chopping, and had just started to sample a few instrument sounds. Check out the Rezo Bass for the MPC X/Live/One, if you‚Äôre looking for a bass sound that didn‚Äôt even make it into the DnB track. I had literally just sampled it and saw the ‚Äúoops‚Äù post. Anyways‚Ä¶ somewhat of a lost opportunity as I had wanted to do a DnB track for a change, but also figured I had invested enough time and energy and wanted to go a different direction with the next track.
