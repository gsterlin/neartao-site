    <p>That dang squirrel‚Ä¶ taking my food!
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/hamburled
Putting this track together was fun‚Ä¶ but I did struggle a bit (again) with audio tracks, external midi, and exporting the file. I know I grumbled about this before, but Akai really needs to get an ability to mix in from the inputs for a track if/when you need to. I suppose posting everything to audio tracks is fine, but the workflow is just wonky to me. I‚Äôll quit my belly aching on it, but it did lead to a bit of a mess uploading a track that was missing a core synth part. On the pro soundcloud account it‚Äôs not a *huge* problem to replace a track, but boy was it funny to go back and listen to the track and notice it was missing. It‚Äôs something I can fix in my on process for creating and publishing songs, but‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a hassle. Also‚Ä¶ to be fair, even if there was a checkbox to use external gear to get it in from the inputs I‚Äôd probably still complain about it being a problem because then I‚Äôd probably double up sounds, or cause myself other problems. Maybe it is fine Akai? Maybe! This is just something that‚Äôs been such an ingrained workflow in DAWs though, that it does lead me to at least one area where the MPC in standalone isn‚Äôt quite enough as a DAW. Everything inside the box it is cool, but exporting out content it doesn‚Äôt work quite so hot. /grumbling off‚Ä¶

The picture is from some resin structures we made as a family this year. My dad was all about how copper killed COVID or something silly, so he sent us some. I didn‚Äôt buy into it, and I don‚Äôt think he did either, but we ended up all doing remote family molds to just try and make something interesting. I had never poured resin like this before, so it was interesting at least to see the process up close and personal.

I mentioned yesterday that I started working on this track yesterday right after throwing in the towel for day two, and I really dig how this track came out.

The picture comes courtesy of my daughter finding a frog in the backyard over the summer and we caught a few pictures of it. She was super excited to have found such a small critter hanging out in the back yard and just wanted to get a few close ups of the little guy (or gal).
I fiddled with this track a bit throughout the day and it never quite came together the way I wanted. I tried to play everything out by hand as much as possible, and well‚Ä¶ I find it okay. The transitions between sections are particularly week again, and I know I could have done better to build up more energy if I had just had the time. Instead I decided to cut my losses on this track and move forward to preparing for day three instead‚Ä¶ which meant this track suffered.

First off, the picture is of my oldest dog, Amy (pronounced Emmy). I was trying to find a picture that might feel a little dreamy, where you might not quite know what was going on, was maybe a little shocking, but not really in the terrifying space. This was a picture from taking Amy home from being spayed, and we had to put the cone on her head to keep her from licking the wound. She is by no means intimidating, and is actually one of the sweetest dogs you could find, but this picture does make her look a little haunted.

This track came about from creating an audio track from a 32 bar loop on the Access Virus TI2 Darkstar. I automated a few parameters and figured it sound cool enough to add some drums and FX to it. I wanted to try and get something slower and more droning this time around, instead of some of the faster and more manic tracks I have been laying down the last month.
