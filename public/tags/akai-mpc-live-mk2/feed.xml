      <title>CooperFX: Arcades - Satellite Sound Walkthrough</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was bummed to hear that CooperFX was going to end making guitar pedals, but super excited to learn that the next move is to begin working on pedals with Chase Bliss Audio. Amazing! Even more amazing, is that the Satellite card was released as the last card for the Cooper FX: Arcades. Definitely excited to hear what is in store for CooperFX in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this is the last hurrah for the Arcades. My advice to others, unless you have a reason to have the Satellite card for the XP-300 space station emulation, I&amp;rsquo;d hold out and see what this morphs into over in Chase Bliss land.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Isolation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/11/13/track-isolation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not sure why, but this feels like it is in the space of the &amp;lsquo;peak sound&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve been working towards with this setup. Still a bit noisy and still a bit awkward to control sometimes, but hands on, a bit glitchy, and something that can sustain momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/t1mUOeepWNw&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/t1mUOeepWNw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track started the day as something happier, but as it wore on, I just kind of went into my own space of wishing, longing, dreaming, but all at a distance with some strange energy. Not the track I had set off to put together but it might be the track I needed to put together right now. I do like this, and hope that others get something out of it too, but I guess I just had poured a lot more self reflective vibes here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MPC Forums Beat Battle #321 - How You Flop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, shout out to MPC Forums, and check out the Beat Battle #321 thread if you want to see what others are up to at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&#34;&gt;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this track was about 90 minutes to put together? A lot of the time was spent chopping, and then finding different lines. I gave a stab at an initial 8 bar sequence and figured it was okay enough. I know I normally go at this as one long sequence, but I really want the sound to change over the course of the track, so although each 8 bar sequence could more or less stand on it&amp;rsquo;s own, I felt it would be fun to make a few different once and then use song mode (for once) to chain them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on trying to figure out where I am having issues with my audio setup, to try and get a hotter signal in my video recordings. So I drew up a rough sketch to see if I could get some notes on what the issue might be and go from there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/audio-setup-sketch.jpg?w=1024&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long component with the knobs/buttons on it that is unlabelled is the Behringer RX1602 that I picked up&amp;hellip; I just forgot to label it apparently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did a thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3P5SMy9Ul-w&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/3P5SMy9Ul-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the track didn&amp;rsquo;t use the eurorack for much, but I did a bit of processing through it before recording a bunch of audio into the SPs, then chopping that content up on the MPC to actually play it. Given all the noise it became a bit of a hassle to prepare all of the samples on the MPC because it just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the start/end with threshold very well, but it felt like it was worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a somewhat simple lunch break track&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/OvOWOcHukWI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/OvOWOcHukWI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track was so many takes to get to this somewhat still janky state. At least fifteen, and the worst is that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t setup the input/recorder properly to actually capture any takes. I had a good one or two in there, and then realized I was recording off of the microphone and not off of the Zoom H6 inputs. Doh!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also fighting with some CV outputs from the MPC to gates into the Pam&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; because&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m rolling my eyes at myself, I had not recorded off the triggers at all. So it was constantly loosing sync, the resets were doing what I wanted, but well&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can get the idea. I really need to create a template for my setup so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep remembering all this twiddly bits that can cause me a problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a long day, day off for my daughter, and some arguments. She&amp;rsquo;s not happy that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t pay for her to eat at Starbucks, and I&amp;rsquo;m not happy to be treated as a piggy bank. So put this together to just decompress and relax a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/&lt;/a&gt;_l0eLSWeR4g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just used the same setup/patch in the eurorack as yesterday, but I did leave the guitar track (on accident) going straight to the outputs. Honestly, it was probably the right choice, but well&amp;hellip; it is what it is :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - The Streets Watch Back</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3478</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Been trying to work out some issues, and make tracks louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/vDzTg5h65RI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/vDzTg5h65RI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track I tried to push into using the morphagene for a bit of ambient noise to bring in and out to an okay effect. Probably something that is better to automate with an envelope so have it swell in over time, but that&amp;rsquo;ll mean considering a rewatching of how everything is setup, which I suppose I am due for anyways, since over the last month I have had some grumbles about how some of the gates, attenuators, and other things have been configured. I can effectively get 4 discrete signal paths out to the Befaco STMix, and so far I&amp;rsquo;ve tried applying a path like MPC Live -&amp;gt; Morphagene -&amp;gt; Sqwak Dirty -&amp;gt; Mimeophon -&amp;gt; Data Bender -&amp;gt; STMix, and while this works, it has left Beads out, which I&amp;rsquo;ve then added in by peeling off the signal from Sqwak Dirty -&amp;gt; Beads -&amp;gt; STMix. There is some value in having two discrete paths for the same voice, but I think I need to consider what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get, and which types of sounds or effects make the most sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beatober2021 #31 - Project Morpheus</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3472</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on feedback, tried to make this track much louder, and maybe got a little too carried away. Now I think it has pushed into a bit too crunchy and toasty territory. I probably should not have been driving the STMix so hard :/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bass line is only 2 bars long and absolutely needs some variations to move it around, or something to tie off every 4 or 8 bars… just something different. Ah well, this was fun and definitely deserves a second try at thinking about how to drive all the content through the eurorack anyways, and might be something to expand on some more to build out into a set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A day track this time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HbXDBwXj53k&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/HbXDBwXj53k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded off some samples onto the SP-202, slowed them down, and tried to get a bit of the LoFi 1 crunch to get a bit into the Vaporwave space, but this is definitely not 80&amp;rsquo;s inspired or reminiscent… so I guess it is something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resampled the loops back into the MPC so I could line them up better and get everything into sync, then added drums. There&amp;rsquo;s a touch of Mimeophon on the instruments, and the Instruments/Bass/Drums are getting some Data Bender treatment. I suspect the Bass being so dang low is a mixing problem… especially since I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to mix the track. Oops… will save it off and see if it is a track to come back to in the future to refine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scurried off and used loop mode to record me noodling around on the Triton Studio until I found something that felt decent. I ended up unplugging a bunch of patch cables because there was some CV in place that was messing with me, so ended up with about 10 different but similar recordings, but had a lot of accidental drops and other problems. Was trying to hit something a bit more fun and wacky for today&amp;hellip; and I guess I got there&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just trying to see how much I could squeeze a track down&amp;hellip; with four tracks and pushing the Mimeophon and Data Bender harder than I usually do&amp;hellip; got some interesting results for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly excited by what came out for the first track so decided to give it another try and see what I could do with the 20 minutes before I have to go pick up my daughter&amp;hellip; like this a bit more :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another day and not as much time to dedicate to the track as I&amp;rsquo;d like&amp;hellip; still mostly happy with how it came out though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/24Y1qDwL7X4&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/24Y1qDwL7X4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More of a laid back/chill track for today. With of course, buffers galore, glitch effects, etc&amp;hellip; this required over a dozen practice runs because I was trying to get a bit more movement and hands on with the track, but was causing some incredibly disorienting pitch shifts and swells. The practice helped a lot though, and I think I ended up making a lot less mistakes in this track than some of the previous ones I&amp;rsquo;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just something a little jazzy, a little funky&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track started out life back in August at my sister&amp;rsquo;s house while visiting, and was a subset of a jam session that I did with my brother in law. Sadly, no guitar or other instrument takes were had, so I had to add in some electric piano, pads, and bells to fill the track out a bit, and give it a bit of a jazzier feel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was initially just testing out my reconfigured setup&amp;hellip; but figured I&amp;rsquo;d run with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/L3tj2vKJC&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/L3tj2vKJC&lt;/a&gt;_c&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m abandoning the configuration I am working on for getting multiple tracks together, just that I was getting some more concepts together :D Nothing technically I haven&amp;rsquo;t done before, but this is all tracks that I played out, tweaked notes, velocity and all that fun stuff, to try and get a sound I was going for. Hopefully the levels are working better&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah! Finally getting a vision of some sounds/ideas to put together into a big ol&amp;rsquo; mix and mash of tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/G7u&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/G7u&lt;/a&gt;_6dGFtv4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been so focussed on trying to just get a track done, or only having a half hour that I kind of just forgot about my original goal of putting a set of tracks together. I certainly played around with it a lot, a month or two ago, but I have been more focussing on just doing a track a day for the last couple of months that it passed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I got myself some credits on NeuralBlender&amp;hellip; and actually started buying some art&amp;hellip; whaaaaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to spend some time today trying to think about a way to use the Morphagene as a sample player of some sort&amp;hellip; and got a couple samples going&amp;hellip; didn&amp;rsquo;t go for anything crazy or off the rails&amp;hellip; but they both got some more action today than usual&amp;hellip; so instead of just using them as a passthrough for the MPC outputs, they got some real sounds going&amp;hellip; haha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; here it is for today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track gave me some problems. Mostly Total Recall&amp;hellip; I just realized that it triggers or rather changes parameters on the down event of a clock or gate&amp;hellip; and Pam&amp;rsquo;s was sending a gate for 50% of a beat, meaning that the change was happening on 1.3 instead of 1.1 of a bar. Doh! This was giving me all kinds of problems, and I&amp;rsquo;ll need to rethink how I&amp;rsquo;m using Total Recall. The quick fix was to change the gate width from 50% down to 1%, but I still feel like this leaves some margin for error. Back to the drawing board a bit for how I&amp;rsquo;m using Total recall. Surprisingly, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even noticed this until today&amp;hellip; I guess the more ambient sounds just weren&amp;rsquo;t making me notice it so much, but the arp today&amp;hellip; woah boy&amp;hellip; was it messing with my timing&amp;hellip; took a few tries before I got to the &amp;ldquo;is it me, or is it you&amp;rdquo; thought&amp;hellip; I guess at least it wasn&amp;rsquo;t me this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yah&amp;hellip; sometimes we just need to simplify!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could&amp;rsquo;ve made this into a longer track, but yeah&amp;hellip; I think keeping it short and simple definitely kept it moving and interesting. At least I feel like I got more out of it than I would have otherwise trying to layer a ton of sounds in and then having a big mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively I made the four tracks on the MPC to begin with, and spent the time making sure I was happy with the eight bars first, pretty similar to what I did yesterday. From there I just starting assigning tracks to different outputs on the MPC, and then driving them through different effects in eurorack, and then, as usual, I chased it with the SP 202 and SP 303 at the tail end to just add the dust, grit, and grunge for the song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3403</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track was fun, but I also had a lot more time today to be picky with sound selection, make some various sections, and then add in eurorack for some extra spice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/frcc&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/frcc&lt;/a&gt;_5iL7yo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track started from the much cleaner track recorded on soundcloud that I did pretty much everything on the MPC, and then just ran it through and end chain of SP-202 and SP-303. I actually made a few other tracks that didn&amp;rsquo;t make the cut because they just clashed a bit too much with everything going on here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Decided to keep it simple today&amp;hellip; really simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What all is going on? The picture comes from Neural Blender again&amp;hellip; still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its&amp;rsquo; range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly +4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela&amp;rsquo;s New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; today felt pretty good&amp;hellip; but did like&amp;hellip; five&amp;hellip; maybe six takes&amp;hellip; was getting a bit of a jam going and then would make a mistake&amp;hellip; this take came together pretty well though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/JGcR613&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/JGcR613&lt;/a&gt;_21U&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my pretty traditional setup I&amp;rsquo;ve been going for lately, but with the SP 202 and SP 303 added to the end of the chain&amp;hellip; oh and I&amp;rsquo;ve added in the Zoom H6 at the end of chain to function a bit as a mixer/audio router&amp;hellip; the RCA to 1/4&amp;quot; adaptors are what is causing me the biggest headache in this setup&amp;hellip; but it is kind of nice having the 202 do LPF duties at the end of the chain, and then the Vinyl FX from the 303 to do some compression and wow/flutter duties&amp;hellip; and a hint of vinyl noise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still in a kind of meh&amp;hellip; for making music day&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; still having fun and got a chance to mess with Neural Blender some more. So that&amp;rsquo;s nice :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the track&amp;hellip; well I tried to use some automation on Morphagene&amp;hellip; to limited success&amp;hellip; and just ended up dumping the drums and Vox from the MPC out to Sqwak Dirty and Data Bender&amp;hellip; so uhm&amp;hellip; I dunno&amp;hellip; just a simple thing&amp;hellip; but I kind of feel like I need to start from a bit more of a square one and figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m actually interested in doing again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;the music is a bit more pedestrian&amp;hellip; and just Akai MPC Live mk2 all the way baby&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just tired I guess? Having a hard time finding inspiration? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; maybe I just need to sleep better.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; still tired, but at least off my butt to do some music today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still hitting a problem recording audio&amp;hellip; but I think it is me&amp;hellip; as the two tracks don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be the same. I recorded several takes, but somehow the last recording didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to match between the YouTube video and the soundcloud audio&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m doing something wrong. Probably too tired to do everything correctly&amp;hellip; doh!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything too fancy going on, just some loops played through the MPC Live&amp;rsquo;s new 2.10 Firmware effect Half Speed, with some extra filtering and effect tweaking to get it into the audio space that I felt would work well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3351</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So uhm&amp;hellip; apparently I forgot how to operate my gear&amp;hellip; clearly what happens when I take a break for a single day and use the pocket operators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/T7jdc69J9G8&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/T7jdc69J9G8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this track I disconnected the entire hot mess from a couple days ago&amp;hellip; and just really went to focus on basics. I decided I wanted to try recording in a few chords into the Morphagene and then using Pam&amp;rsquo;s New Workout on a random LFO to send a change to which splice was selected&amp;hellip; and it works pretty nicely except for one problem. The Morphagene doesn&amp;rsquo;t switch to the next sound until partway through playing&amp;hellip; so either I need to work out clocking issues, or change config.txt settings or&amp;hellip; something. It works fine for this track more or less, but required some playing around and bumbling around to get some rhythm that sounded like it could work with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yeah&amp;hellip; not really sure what to make of this&amp;hellip; other than way too many patch cables&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a serious mess. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what I have done any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The image is just my work pc&amp;hellip; with a mysterious rocket flying into it? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; I hardly could muster the energy to pull this together. Guess it&amp;rsquo;s just one of those brained out lame tracks&amp;hellip; that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really figure out what to do with it&amp;hellip; and everything I did made it worse. Good thing it was maybe 20 minutes of time invested, instead of a lot of work that would make me sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alright putting this track together was a pain&amp;hellip; I had too many different elements going on, and out of the *nine* recording attempts&amp;hellip; only one was halfway decent. My biggest problem is that about a third of what I put together just didn&amp;rsquo;t mesh with the other parts of the track. I&amp;rsquo;d keep recording and trying to decide which way to go with it, but it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t happening. The synth lines didn&amp;rsquo;t gel, the Lofi arps didn&amp;rsquo;t gel, it just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to come together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For this track I built it up off of 16 clips from an expansion, made sure to use each one&amp;hellip; and then did a track explode on the MPC, set the pads 1-8 to output to 5/6 (and thus on the bottom chain of FX of the eurorack), and set pads 9-16 to output to 3/4 (the top chain of FX of the eurorack).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly me just using track mutes from here, and then turning knobs on the eurorack to jam out, cut up, glitch, and otherwise morph and destroy the various elements of the track that are playing. A few places feel like they didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work, but hey&amp;hellip; gotta try right?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beatober2021 #01 - Up Close</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Beatober&lt;/em&gt; and time to try and focus a bit more on beats again. Just trying to kick the tires on a stringing a single song together between the Eurorack and Akai MPC Live mk2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/uy&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/uy&lt;/a&gt;_K090EF_g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-01-up-close?si=a78bc5bed4a44a29b9bb9b39fe640180&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/beatober2021-01-up-close?si=a78bc5bed4a44a29b9bb9b39fe640180&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is just from my dog being sleepy on the chair beside me. Felt like a good chill out song and she&amp;rsquo;s not chilling out much more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as putting this all together&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly building out the rack patch, and I setup the Akai MPC outputs 3/4 as the drums going through the top of the rack, and outputs 5/6 for the piano and bass on the bottom of the rack. This is then all going into the ST Mix for mixing a somewhat clean signal together with a copied and glitched out signal. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of knobs to be trying to keep in mind while also muting and unmuting parts, so I probably just need to work out my process a bit more consciously to keep it all in my head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#jamtember2021 Jam Session - Slick Fool</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/09/30/jamtember2021-jam-session-slick-fool/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3301</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last track/jam for the month&amp;hellip; going to see what I can put together for beatober next :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/in3OUNSvj6U&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/in3OUNSvj6U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time messing around for the month, and wanted to fix up a few things on my patching. For this, I ended up just doing two different track ideas and routing one track through 3/4 of the MPC, and the second track through 5/6 of the MPC. This then went into both the Morphagenes, mostly because it was already hooked up this way. In fact, I tried to mostly use what I&amp;rsquo;ve been building up for a patch over the last two days, but I did straighten out my mixer to have the ST Mix have 1) Track 1 FX chain A 2) Track 1 FX chain B 3) Track 2 FX chain A 4) Track 2 FX chain B. This helped me keep some sanity for which ST Mix knobs were controlling which parts of the sound.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#jamtember2021 Track - Sunny Side Up</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/09/29/jamtember2021-track-sunny-side-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:04:26 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3290</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some house music&amp;hellip; recorded some of the jam off to the Wav Recorder&amp;hellip; and some of it made it to the YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sunny-side-up&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sunny-side-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is just a quick doodle that I did on my iPad. Just done in ProCreate&amp;hellip;. just now&amp;hellip; while thinking about what to do with this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTZKFYO1Bwg?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a few notes here&amp;hellip; I am routing all of my output on the MPC out either 3/4 or 5/6, and into the Eurorack, and then processing everything through a couple different chains including Morphagene, Mimeophon, Beads, Sqwk Dirty, and Data Bender, and then going out to the ST Mix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use some of the patching done yesterday for the ambient tracks to make some DnB&amp;hellip; woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice Session first&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of mistakes, offbeat content, and a few places that some of the sounds got a bit too wild&amp;hellip; oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/pg0K1Gk5toI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/pg0K1Gk5toI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I did a few more takes and settled on the following take as the &amp;lsquo;final&amp;rsquo; for this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/mgsyQkY1LUk&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/mgsyQkY1LUk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want a higher quality version of the audio for this final (probably) take you can get it at SoundCloud from below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just messing around way more today than I have all month&amp;hellip; but this is for better or worse lol :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Jam Session&amp;hellip; just loaded up a kit and figured I&amp;rsquo;d mess around for 10-15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/gOaEgEJVQDg&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/gOaEgEJVQDg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end I had no idea what I had in the Morphagene buffers, and just kind of went with it. Not really choices I should have made, but whatever&amp;hellip; just messing around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3248</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is two takes&amp;hellip; I recorded some YouTube videos and uploaded to soundcloud as well&amp;hellip; take two is better, but just wanted to show what the heck I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/latitude-take-1&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/latitude-take-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And&amp;hellip; here are the YouTube videos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Y9hKEfEy244&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/Y9hKEfEy244&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/m9KpYLJNtMU&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/m9KpYLJNtMU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; for those who are interested&amp;hellip; finally gettin Beads added to the case and was just messing around with the Beat Slicer mode to see how well it would work by itself and with Data Bender. I&amp;rsquo;m digging it, but feel like I need to get a bit more control over it on the MPC side&amp;hellip; or record some better sequences/patterns into the Eurorack modules (Pams/Tete/Mimetic Digitalis&amp;hellip; whatever)&amp;hellip; or not. Definitely going to keep trying but I feel like this was a bit too much glitch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah yeah yeah&amp;hellip; another vaporwave style&amp;hellip; and I swear, I&amp;rsquo;ll get some videos up of the process I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;hellip; honestly nothing too fancy, but I should probably see if I can get something similar to work just within the MPC instead of needing two&amp;hellip; retro/older&amp;hellip; Boss SPs&amp;hellip; yet&amp;hellip; it is frequently working&amp;hellip; so what do I know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; you literally have to smile when you hear the song and see the pic together&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s like illegal or something if you don&amp;rsquo;t. Now&amp;hellip; you don&amp;rsquo;t have to like either individually, but as a total package&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/dont-forget-grandma&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/dont-forget-grandma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my grandmother, or as many people knew her, as the world&amp;rsquo;s grandma. She was a great woman who cared for everybody. Honestly, she was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; just standard song duty for the day, kinda hit or miss again for me&amp;hellip; probably time to push myself in another direction, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to see what happens if I just do the same style/process for a month. What I think is happening is that I&amp;rsquo;m getting faster at the process, but also getting pickier&amp;hellip; who&amp;rsquo;d have thought?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; this kind of went into the DnB direction&amp;hellip; and I just gave it a shot&amp;hellip; takes 30 seconds to come together, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really great&amp;hellip; but maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/everything-hurts&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/everything-hurts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the picture. Well this is my friend bee. Found the poor guy hanging out on my deck post, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t flying away. So I gave him some honey, which he ate up for a while. Later the honey and the bee were gone. Either I saved the bee&amp;rsquo;s life in its&amp;rsquo; time of need, or I ended up attracting something bigger that ate the bee. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. But as my friend, I am going to imagine that I saved the bee, and in the future he&amp;rsquo;s going to communicate to his bee buddies that I helped save his life and that he&amp;rsquo;ll return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Haven&amp;rsquo;t been feeling some of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together, but still committing to doing something, anything&amp;hellip; at least once a day. And folks are posting for beatober&amp;hellip; do I go for it? Maybe&amp;hellip; but gonna have to do something different, cuz I&amp;rsquo;m definitely finding it hard to squeeze the time in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I just used the picture from a website&amp;hellip; sue me&amp;hellip; well don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; but I didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to have eight lambic around to photograph&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another track in the vaporwave style&amp;hellip; or rather&amp;hellip; dumping some loops/sounds into the SP-202 and making something pitched down&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m probably abusing this too much by now for making a track a day for the month&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; if it works? Keep on filtering? Keep on trying out the new synths on the MPC from 2.10? I mean heck yeah!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; weird glitchy noise track :D. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t go nuts with bit crushing or anything&amp;hellip; yeah me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/wake-the-giant&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/wake-the-giant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture is a filtered statue&amp;hellip; from Chicago&amp;hellip; I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track is literally just a bunch of glitchy noises that I figured it&amp;rsquo;d be fun to see if I could put together into a track. Had to take the time to put some of the samples into Key Groups so I could actually play everything together&amp;hellip; in as much of a tune as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shot off a second track for the day&amp;hellip; this time some DnB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my daughter&amp;rsquo;s teddy bear, from years ago when we took a train ride in northern New Hampshire. Tea and scones were absolutely had, at this simply fabulous tea party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track was pretty simple&amp;hellip; just did my vaporwave thing&amp;hellip; found four loops that seemed to work together&amp;hellip; though this admittedly took a while today&amp;hellip; because I tried five or six combinations that seemed fine, but when recorded as Lofi on the SP-202 and then slowed down they sounded quite poor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not exactly sure what I was trying to do here&amp;hellip; but this is all inside the MPC&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/constant-barrage&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/constant-barrage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a picture of one of my dogs eyeballs&amp;hellip; really close up&amp;hellip; hah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track was really just taking some samples, a few of them run through the SP-202, and then seeing what I could put together. In particular I spent a lot more time on the drums in the SP-202, with a bit of added distortion from the SP-303 to just give them a bit more punch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mostly happy with how this track came out&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/always&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/always&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture is just of the SP-202&amp;hellip; just thought it looked kinda cool all lit up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track itself came together pretty quickly, though I did have to go tweak a number of samples once I ran it through YAM&amp;hellip; all of a sudden I was noticing all kinds of clipping and noise. The atmospheric sound at the beginning was full of so many pops and clips. I didn&amp;rsquo;t remove all of them, but definitely reduced it a bit by just tweaking the program. The bass was just super noisy, probably as a result from having run it through the SP-202 a bit, so I had to drop a LPF on it to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something that I was working on last month, and dug up to make sure it got completed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flexing&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flexing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from the zoo we visited in Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track itself I worked on while visiting my sister and came about from trying to prep some content for jamming with my brother in law. We got a couple good jam sessions in, but nothing recorded. This particular track was something that I was just up in the morning messing with and had saved off for a while and figured it was something worth saving to work on and finishing later. Up at 6am this morning, got a long day ahead, and figured it was as good a time as any to run it across the finish line!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just another quick one&amp;hellip; really dug the time stretched loop and figured I&amp;rsquo;d drop another quick sketch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really, just worked through sampling a few loops into the SP 202, then PITCH and FILTER 1 to taste, and then running it through the SP 303 for some extra flavor as usual. Hype came in for the rescue for a few other sounds just to round it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know, two tracks in one day&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m having too much fun making fake vaporwave tracks with the SPs, and my second power adaptor showed up so I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to hook back up the Boss SP-303 as well. This lead to making this song with both the 202 and 303. Magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another picture from Hawaii, but I ran it through a stormy PS Camera filter. This particular picture was from the helicopter ride, so dang fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/exponential-horizon&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/exponential-horizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just four samples&amp;hellip; most of which I ran through the SP-202 and pitched down and used the filter, some chopping, and nothing else too fancy. Honestly, just wanted to put together some 8 bar loops and see where things went from there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one was a blast to put together&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ash-left-on-my-face&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ash-left-on-my-face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is a photoshop filter on a record. So nothing&amp;hellip; exactly exciting&amp;hellip; but well&amp;hellip; whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this track together was a bit of work digging for samples and finding stuff that I liked. The hardest thing was actually pulling the bass together. Originally I had a non stop sound, and was applying different gated filters, and it just felt wrong. Like it should belong to an electronic or techno sound. It was nice by itself, but just not for this track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just knocking something out fairly quickly over lunch for day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from years ago&amp;hellip; Aruba I think? I&amp;rsquo;ll have to look it up and see if I can figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the track, I did another fake 4 bar loop to turn into a vaporwave track. So quite similar process to the last few days. The big difference here is *way* more automation, filtering, and for the first half of the song I used the Air Halfspeed plugin to make the vaporwave component feel slower. The whole track was going much much slower than I usually go for, so I really just tried to lock in what felt like a leaned way back vibe and go with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well today I felt like messing around with making a vaporwave styled song&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another picture courtesy of my trip to Hawaii. Really gorgeous island, and could definitely just hang out at the beach for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make vaporwave you usually take some old 80&amp;rsquo;s music, find a loop, time stretch it way down, and then drop a beat on top of it&amp;hellip; maybe some filtering, reverb, or other fx to boot, but the idea is super easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expecting today to be a bit crazy, and I woke up early. So got the dogs out, and decided to get to business. Dogs out at 6:00am, fed, and in front of the MPC by 6:10am. Looking at the clock now and it is 6:52am. So factoring for upload time and stuff&amp;hellip; I guess a 35 minute track from start to finish?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from my trip with my family to Hawaii. Was taking an early morning walk with my wife and saw the bird up in the tree. Not sure what kind of bird it is, but it was definitely striking!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did some of the work yesterday for this track&amp;hellip; just happened to have some extra time to kick it off. Then today&amp;hellip; happened. A lot going on, but I really wanted to get some more going for the track by adding a few more sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from Hawaii, and I had gotten my wife a coconut to drink. She loves it&amp;hellip; I keep trying to drink coconut water, but frankly it is not for me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is healthy, but just not my thing. My wife can drink it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner though!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is another one from the walk. Just some train tracks that I had to walk over, and look like a good time to snap a quick picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly though, what I had for lunch. Chicken Tikka Masala, and boy did it hit the spot! Sure it was store bought, packaged, and needed to be reheated, but it is what I had available at the time, or I could have had some fajita leftovers, but I think I am saving those for tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This should get me within striking distance of, six tracks left to do afterwards I think&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ll have to try and just hit that before the end of the month. Maybe do a couple tracks a day to fill it out :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my 6 mile walk the other day&amp;hellip; just took a ton of pictures that I figured might come in handy for interesting song images. The empty discarded bottle on the side of the street just seemed interesting enough to me that I walked by it, turned around, and came back to take a picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Hungers</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3006</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track started while I was out visiting my sister and her family last week. Was just sitting on a chair and knocking out some sounds to see what would stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/hungers&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/hungers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a library, the venting looked interesting so a snapped a picture. Ran it through a Ps Camera filter (elements?) just to see how it would look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is a mix of loops I grabbed, and loading up some synths and using pad performer to try and get some other sounds in tune with the loops I was grabbing. Not rocket science, but the way that the loops were reported as a key in the MPC Sample Edit section made it a bit awkward to figure a few things out. Mostly because the MPC refuses to acknowledge flats, so it always thinks everything is sharp. Not a big deal per se, but it can mean that you&amp;rsquo;ve got to think through what key/note range it thinks content is in and then break it down into what you are actually going to play. Sure if you do it right it all matches up regardless if you are sharp or flat, but it can mean that the way you think about some of the notes is just off, if that makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just posted a video up on some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve done over the last few weeks to experiment with getting the new MPC line to talk with Eurorack and get everything in sync. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing to fancy or special, but felt like this might be useful for others who are trying to figure out how to do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: So I decided to do a third iteration of the track, because all the tapping noises were bugging me. Anyways&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s revision three.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This video shows how to sync up your MPC Live mk2/X/One over CV gates to a Pamela&amp;rsquo;s New Workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not too worried about the variance in the BPM that shows up at higher levels. I&amp;rsquo;ve monitored the gates being sent over CV and have seen that it is not dropping gates, so over time the average will be correct, even if there is a small variance in the BPM at a specific gate trigger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Folks seem to have liked the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2021/01/18/so-you-just-bought-an-akai-mpc-500-what-next/&#34;&gt;You just bought an Akai MPC 500, what next?&lt;/a&gt; post, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time to put one together for the MPC Live/X/One family of MPCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;internal-storage&#34;&gt;Internal Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am moving this to the top, as a warning to MPC buyers. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off from buying the device, but just to help keep your sanity if you are thinking of purchasing one or have just purchased one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Setup Your Akai MPC Live/X using Bluetooth Midi with your iPad running Synth One</title>

&lt;p&gt;Well folks, I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to try and help you out for questions in the comments. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this Synth One specific video helps. I suspect that the issue with the MPC not seeing audio is due to the user not hooking up the audio outputs from their iPad/iPhone to the MPC, but just a guess. Hopefully this will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Midi only carries note data such as what note number and velocity, it does not carry audio information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick video to answer a comment from a viewer, and help show how to use Q-Links on your MPC to control external gear. Since I had it setup already, I just used it all from my iPad, but this will work on other external gear as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/0peJwPHkcW0&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/0peJwPHkcW0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m sure some of the things I was doing in the video will be a little tough to catch from the angle and size of the screen, I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline all the steps below as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Personally I shopped around and was able to get it with discounts/sales at Best Buy a year ago for $60. It does give you a lot of features though, so definitely worth checking out if it is compatible with your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on some questions, I decided to put together a quick post on how to use a Midi USB adaptor with your iPad to control your Akai MPC. This should work on any Midi equipped device, but below is the video I created as a short walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/E19Dxo7N4uY&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/E19Dxo7N4uY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Took my family to Boston, left the dogs home. Came back to the dogs having eaten up my notebook. Like WTF&amp;hellip; we were an hour late from your usual feeding time, was it necessary to eat up my Hobonichi? Fortunately they didn&amp;rsquo;t eat up any important notes, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure Tomo River paper is good for their digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s the end of the month, not really sure what this track is, but it&amp;rsquo;s in the *shrug* whatever&amp;hellip; it is the end of the month, and I ran out of time for the day to really pull something together. Guess I need to live with my failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from my daughter walking away from me going to the mall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wrist is still really sore. Talked to the nurse, they can get me in to see me in about a week. Said to try some Ibuprofen in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think hitting the pads is causing me problems, this is similar to some issues I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past, but far more extreme. Not really sure, but stretching seems to help. Also trying to avoid typing quite so much for work. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Still sucks hitting the pads, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to take a bit more mind of hitting the pads. I want to finish off the month and not have too much &amp;ldquo;junk&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably spent more time than I should have, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t help my right wrist much, but I&amp;rsquo;m really trying to figure out where the pain is, and if it is more from typing, sitting at a desk, hitting stuff, or what. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I have CTS or something, but the palm of my hand is sore, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention before but my right index finger is now cold. That started about a week ago, the coldness, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another picture of the 3 string my dad made for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not in great shape wrist wise, hitting the pads sucks, but I wanted to pull something out, and at least I&amp;rsquo;m happy enough with it. Just tried to keep it super simple and not worry about it, so I can worry about myself. Going to try and end out the month, but need to take care of myself as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to get more done, but my wrist is absolutely killing me. Not sure if I pulled something, popped something, strained it, or just getting old. I really dig what I started here but I cannot handle tapping, typing or anything out. Might be done guys.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Okay forehead. Yes it is mine&amp;hellip; some picture of me with sunglasses, and probably thinking about how cool I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of basic, and maybe a little too stripped down, and yet I got something together. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just not feeling it really. A lot is going on and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I am going to finish the month off or not. Deal with it? I am dealing with it, but a track a day, plus family, plus a full-time job&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a lot sometimes. Especially when you don&amp;rsquo;t get started until the end of the day to make a track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, a dead spider in a glass. I think I used the picture before&amp;hellip; so sue me :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another stab at the LoFi sound, this one has a bit too much going on, but I do like the worn out sound, and had fun going different places in the different sections. Another one that feels like a pretty good stab at moving more towards a finished track than I have been in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The image is a double exposure. My nephew painting me an Isaac for Christmas, and I got around to hanging it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, well it&amp;rsquo;s wonky and glitched out a bit, but was something fun and mysterious. Have to see what to do with it next!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just an error code from my printer. Why? Well why not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the track goes&amp;hellip; is this space elevator music? I have no idea, but it sure is cheery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of some wrapping paper I think&amp;hellip; boy I forget what I took it from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, wanted to try a dark LoFi kind of sound, and I kind of like what I nailed here, but the mix is too low, and it really needs some mastering to kick it into gear. Feels like something that&amp;rsquo;s near where I&amp;rsquo;d want a completed track to be though, so I dig it :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s my mouth&amp;hellip; hah&amp;hellip; no screaming though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea where this came from, but it just felt like a goofy kind of Summer DJ track to me. Not sure what to do with it, it probably needs some more high end sparkle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a bill that my dog ate. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I know the one. I&amp;rsquo;ve taped the bill back together, so it ought to be legal tender, but it just looked like something worth using for a track image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a ton of fun working on grooving with this track, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s on the list of something I really need to get back on and turn it into something to finish as a track. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve got some work in front of me to get all these things moving :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I just scribbled this down in a notebook to get the picture&amp;hellip; nothing fancy, but I needed some kind of artwork and had no other idea what to do. Seems kinda cool though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the track itself, I wanted to spend some more time putting together the track, so there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more elements going on and it feels like a bit more complete of an idea to me at least. The Vox is okay&amp;hellip; I suppose I should&amp;rsquo;ve taken out the high end synth&amp;hellip; and just recorded my own vocals. Next time I do a month of tracks, probably need to force myself to do my own vocals and see where I go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I literally cannot believe that it snowed today. But then again, welcome to New England baby&amp;hellip; the snow didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long, but we got probably 4-5 inches. Enough to notice and stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to make something chill for the day, so it&amp;rsquo;s nothing too crazy, but just kind of a laid back vibe. I mean yeah&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;ve probably got the last day of snow for the season&amp;hellip; better relax and enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alright&amp;hellip; first&amp;hellip; I really had fun on this track, as short as it is. This feels like something I want to come back to and finish when I have some proper time to focus on it. The intent was to get something kind of light and refreshing&amp;hellip; and I feel like this hit that itch for me. Just a nice little wall of sounds all working together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just a silly little doodle I had done in my notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, just trying to work out something a bit wonky and that felt off kilter today. I kind of dig the vibe, though I don&amp;rsquo;t know so much about the Vox. The track needed some vocals, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s something better to go in here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I got it in my head to try and do a bit of a disco track. The track kind of has the funk a bit, but I feel like it&amp;rsquo;s missing an element or two to make it really scream disco. As it stands, it feels like it is missing half the band, but I was running out of time to put something together and just wanted to see where this could get me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of a 3 string cigar box guitar my dad made for me. Something I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get to work better for some time. I&amp;rsquo;ll get into it in a blog post somewhere, but my dad didn&amp;rsquo;t align a few parts correctly, so it needs some love!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the song, I was really just trying to go for a straight up hip hop/break beat kind of sound, and keep it moving. I like the track overall, but think it could use some stripping back of a few elements, and maybe add something a little different? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, seems like something I am poking on a bit for what I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together lately. Time for some self reflection?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, an MPC Forums Beat Battle&amp;hellip; I honed in on a section that I thought would loop well enough, chopped it up, and then focussed on the chops that sounded good enough. This track turned into three different sections that I just used song mode to string together. Was a fun track to flip, even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly spend a ton of time working on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alright this track is just me messing around with FX&amp;hellip; mostly delay, and trying to make something that feels happier. I know it is super goofy, but it was fun to put together. Probably needs to be peeled back a little on that arp/synth part&amp;hellip; or get it&amp;rsquo;s own section to fill out&amp;hellip; but this just put a smile on my face while working on it :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from a trip to Greece I took two years ago with my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was trying to put something a bit more LoFi sounding together, and I kind of feel like I failed. The mix is just off, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really feel dirty enough. Overall, I find the bass too loud and it probably needs some major taming. What was I thinking? Uhm&amp;hellip; not sure lol!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;For this track I was trying to think about transitions between sections a bit more, and trying to see how it would come together. I kind of think the higher end synth sound is a bit distracting, and the track would probably be better without it. Maybe a few too many elements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy with the track feeling a bit more funky though, and trying to add in a few more somewhat random sounds moving in and out feels like a good effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;First, the image comes courtesy of my dogs chewing up my daughter&amp;rsquo;s homework. She had left it someplace where they could get at it, and while I was out at the recycling center they decided to have a snack apparently. It looks like she was making a song for her class as part of an assignment, but she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tell me what it was for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track is just some loops I selected and put together. Nothing crazy, but I was looking to make something with some different sounds than I usually put together and see what I could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m on the fence about that noise loop chopped up, it adds some interesting ambience to the track, but I think I could have done something different with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Who said you can only do one track a day max? I had about 30 minutes free and ripped this one. I dig how it came out compared to the other track. I think most of what I like about it is that it&amp;rsquo;s simpler, and while it is pretty in your face, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have quite so much going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/lets-grab-lunch&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/lets-grab-lunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another Boss SP 303 sampled song, I spent a *lot* of time sampling into the SP 303, and then resampled back into the MPC. There are some things that I like here, but boy was it a lot of work, and honestly, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the result was entirely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like some of the sounds and how they came out, but I feel like this is not really that great. The Vox probably could use more work to make it different or change over time, and this is where I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m hitting a bit of a wall with producing exclusively on the MPC right now. Just a bit too much work to pull the audio apart and do something different with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day five of #jampril2021 and still going. Made another drum kit and posted it up on the discord server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/big-hammer&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/big-hammer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track was still hitting it into the Boss SP 303 and just recording off more samples for the FX. Definitely getting faster at sampling into the 303 and then resampling back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried track mutes with timing corrects which worked out alright&amp;hellip; then doubled up the track and layered in a new track with some additional sounds/enhancements to spice things up. The mix is a bit off, but happy enough with how the track came out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is day four track&amp;hellip; and another one working with the SP 303 to sample and mess with the FX a bit. What did I do exactly? Uh&amp;hellip; not sure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/breathing-in&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/breathing-in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another track of sampling into the SP 303, and running effects and stuff, and then sampling back into the MPC to make a finished drum kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played everything out with the Track Mute again&amp;hellip; but this time used TC. It helped a bit&amp;hellip; at least making it more obvious where problems were. Would try again hah.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 3&amp;hellip; This track I mostly wanted to mess around with the Boss SP 303 to understand the sampling workflow a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is Isaac from the game &amp;ldquo;The Binding of Isaac&amp;rdquo;. Cool kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this together I drove samples into the SP 303 C and D banks. They are much faster to sample on, even though it is still quite slow compared to modern standards. It was a pretty good way to test out the repair job that I did for the pads as well, since I was bouncing around a lot of the buttons, minus the pattern stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how much I care to bother with pattern sequencing here when I can just resample everything into the MPC. So I filled up all 16 smart media sample slots between bank C and D&amp;hellip; The samples came in between a mix of raw, and sometimes with some effects already running, and I did end up adding effects on the way out back into the MPC as well to make a drum kit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to this&amp;hellip; just roped in some different expansion sounds&amp;hellip; the synth and the bass from the MPC Juno sound pack. The drums&amp;hellip; I forget. If I remember I will look it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really just knocked this out by laying out the drums and the chords in the drum kit really quick, and then loading up the two synth sounds. I setup pad performer notes at Gb Major just to knock it all out hopefully in tune, and then put it through the ringer of expanding the track to 64 bars and then track muting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As for the track, this is straight up another MPC Live track. I grabbed a handful of samples and just got to chopping. I know I could have done a better job getting some of the slices together, but I tried to do it by ear as much as possible, and hey, I continue to approve of the slightly wonky and janky sound. So it was a lot of using the threshold chop mode to get the party started, and then adjusting the start/end points a bit by ear. I know for sure that a few of the mistakes in the chops came from forgetting to turn off the linked slices afterwards, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t really been doing much for tracks over the last TWO months, which has gotten me quite a bit out of practice. Only done a few hit or miss beat battles in between, and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even bothered to write up a post about them. Well, I do need to get myself more focussed again&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m being foolish, and figuring it is time for me to get back to a track a day. It is my punishment for being lazy for three months and hardly doing any tracks. To be fair I did move over the last three months, had no internet for a month, and was busy building shelving throughout the house, including an at least 30 hour project building a pantry. Excuses excuses&amp;hellip; now I need to get back off my butt!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This track was just to mess around with recording onto the Akai S950 at a ridiculous bandrate and pitched up a lot so I could get most of the track into the S950 to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb304-lucky-number&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb304-lucky-number&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the track is pretty muddy, and a bit of a mess, but whatever I had fun putting it together. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that there is anything worth digging into for production techniques because it was mostly just finding sections that kind of worked, looping some content, and messing with FX.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of a trip I took with my family and in-laws to a butterfly garden when the kids were just two or three. The girls really loved seeing all the insects in their natural habitat. Especially since it was winter outside, and in some sections nearly tropical from the level of humidity. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see the life cycle of these sometimes so foreign creatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just through this track together in an hour for the MPC Beat Battle 302.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just about to go to bed&amp;hellip; not sure I could&amp;rsquo;ve cut this more to the wire&amp;hellip; but&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; I got close lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just drums from outside&amp;hellip; everything else was sampled from the track with an application of vigorous effects and automation where I felt I could get away with it and still have a cohesive track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick video to build on my last post &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2021/02/03/akai-mpc-live-x-one-bluetooth-midi-with-an-ipad/&#34;&gt;Akai MPC Live/X/One Bluetooth MIDI With an iPad&lt;/a&gt; where I had describe how to get a Bluetooth MIDI connection working. In this post I will cover how to quickly get audio out of your iPad into your MPC, and get the MIDI connection over bluetooth to control/sequence the synthesizer on your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recorded another video to go along with the post. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to follow step by step instructions I&amp;rsquo;ll also write them up after the video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kind of funny&amp;hellip; because after doing the two months of making a track a day back to back&amp;hellip; I feel like my flow has transitioned to just putting stuff down in a different sort of way, making it a bit more raw&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a few years back, when Amy was more of a spring chicken. she&amp;rsquo;s still quite an active dog, but she definitely prefers to be laying down on a lap, or being held. Still curious to explore and see new things, but not quite so bold as she once was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been nice to have a few days off from making a track a day, to be able to think a bit more about what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and putting a track together. I still want to do a month two lessons learned for #jamuary2021&amp;hellip; maybe tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll pull my thoughts together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a long time ago, my daughter and I were under a blanket with a flashlight trying to make scary faces. Good times, and nobody got scared. She was a fun kid. I was trying to figure out a good place to use the picture, and this one seemed to be a good fit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting up Midi over Bluetooth and the MPC is dead simple, and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d take some time to make a quick video and write this up for everybody else to enjoy. You&amp;rsquo;ve at least got to give it a try! I kicked this video off from a post Dan B made over at MPC Forums &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=210326&amp;amp;p=1824493#p1824493&#34;&gt;Connecting iPad &amp;amp; EXT Midi Controllers to MPC Live&amp;hellip;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just recorded a video to show how to setup Bluetooth Midi between an Akai MPC Live/X/One and an iPad. I have done these steps with an iPhone as well, and suspect that it would work just fine with plenty of other devices that support Midi over Bluetooth as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second 264kb challenge track I put together and dropped over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=210304&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt;, and a bit more focussed on an experimental sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of a cigar box style guitar my dad made for me for my birthday last year. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly stayed in my closet, though once in a while I have taken it out. There&amp;rsquo;s something a bit messed up with it though, and it honestly needs some TLC. I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what the problem is with it, so that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a problem for me to fix it. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to bring it back to him and see if he can figure out what needs to be done to fix it. If I recall&amp;hellip; the pickups are a bit wonky and not ping up one of the strings very well&amp;hellip; though it could be something else. What does this have to do with the track? Nothing&amp;hellip; just thought it was a kind of need picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;My first entry is a chip tune track, and I tried to use effects that would make this sound like an old 8-bit/16-bit track. It is not authentic, but I was trying to impart some of the low end grit. If you want to check out what I threw together for the track the project files are available here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last day for #jamuary2021&amp;hellip; and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to look towards doing some more music still, but probably at a slower pace so that I can focus on tracks a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/quiet-heart&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/quiet-heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is of the fire pit that we built&amp;hellip; going to miss it when we move to the new house, but we&amp;rsquo;ll create another one :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track came together pretty quickly while I was watching my daughter play the sims, make a character of me&amp;hellip; who she promptly made broke, and then I guess I was then homeless. She had my avatar doing a lot of weird things. It makes me wonder what my daughter thinks of me sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s day 30&amp;hellip; not much of a track&amp;hellip; but maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll grow up some day to be something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a picture of little Zoe&amp;hellip; waiting expectantly to get in the car for a car ride. She&amp;rsquo;s a good girl and deserves as many rides in the car as she can get. Maria Gasolina is her nickname&amp;hellip; she loves to burn that gas :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dunno&amp;hellip; not much to say about the track today. I was trying to get a hip hop/pop (hip pop?) style track going&amp;hellip; and I feel like this is where the track a day is an impediment&amp;hellip; I just need more time to work through it, but I ended up spending about half the day with my parents&amp;hellip; hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen them since before December&amp;hellip; and they only live about 40 or 50 minutes away. Just been a crazy time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from my daughter playing piano for a recital. It was&amp;hellip; three years ago now? She&amp;rsquo;s been learning to play piano for five or six years now, and knows far more about playing music than I do. She can sight read, has very good finger posture, and knows her way around the keys. On the other hand, I try and talk to her about sampling, beat making, song structure, and these are things she doesn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do. Occasionally we will talk and bounce ideas off of each other, but she&amp;rsquo;s not into creating songs, just more interested in reproducing them right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from years ago&amp;hellip; doing an extended family vacation out in Maine&amp;hellip; Jamaica Point?!? Great area, lots of trees, water, everything you could ask for if you wanted a secluded get away. I believe the place we stayed at was originally a camp, it could sleep probably 25-40 people&amp;hellip; massive/sprawling kitchen&amp;hellip; all that fun stuff. Ended up going out on a boat a lot&amp;hellip; plenty of hikes in the woods. It was fun :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For day 27&amp;hellip; I missed the mark&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/broken-garage&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/broken-garage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not really a garage&amp;hellip; but boy was that toy for my daughter busted. I ended up upgrading it with a bunch of additions like a tiny and working tv inside, fixed up the doorbell, it was a pretty rocking little house. When we got it though, it was broken as heck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of like the song I put together. I was kind of thinking about going for a House track&amp;hellip; and as you listen to it you can tell I kind of split between an acid baseline, and some other sounds in there&amp;hellip; and never really committed to a garage track, or a UK track&amp;hellip; or anything else. It straddles the line, but not in a good way. I suspect I need to burn this track with fire&amp;hellip; but today I had been working on two or three other tracks to started out with&amp;hellip; and just never was happy with anything. I guess not every day can be decent or above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just of the moon in my backyard&amp;hellip; I was trying to test out my camera, and for the purposes of what I was trying to do, well it failed&amp;hellip; or I need to learn more options for how to setup the camera on my phone&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s probably me&amp;hellip; which should be the name for my next bad track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my daughter&amp;rsquo;s wand she had when she was in ballet as a tiny tyke. The instructors used the wands as a reward for the younger kids doing a good job and paying attention during the class, and then they could prance around with the wands. Rewards for doing what you want, is a good way to keep kids focussed, but this can work for anybody :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from&amp;hellip; oh my&amp;hellip; two summers ago now, took a road trip out to Montana with my parents, wife, daughter, and dogs. That&amp;rsquo;s my dad&amp;rsquo;s Jeep, hooked up to the back of the RV and ready to go. That trip was an experience, but I would absolutely do it again given the chance. Was a great opportunity to spend time with the family, just veg out on the road, and see a lot of things I just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally get a chance to see. Sometime I should go through the pictures and see if there is anything neat to write about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a trip to Puerto Rico&amp;hellip; probably around twenty years ago now. Just a quick snap that I took while driving by the beach. The water down there is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting the track together, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d work on something a bit more experimental, so not quite so traditional drums and sounds, and just see how it came together. Overall, I am relatively happy with it, but the mixing seems off. I spent some time trying to adjust the levels, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s some EQ and filtering that would need to be done to really make the track pop. I did my best by ear, but I got stuck in a few areas where having some visuals to go with the EQ to see where harmonics are probably would have helped be a bit more precise, instead of just using a low pass and high pass filter to just remove sounds completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The pictures is of a family friend&amp;rsquo;s dog, that just looked super evil for the day. I might have to play with the picture again, because it could really turn into something special. Not today though&amp;hellip; because it&amp;rsquo;s just about time to start preparing for tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is just a straight up noisy DnB track&amp;hellip; I initially wasn&amp;rsquo;t intending to get so gritty but everything just kind of fell into place that way. I had a ton more FX I had layered in, but had a bit of a hard time figuring out if you can automate turning FX on and off (turns out as far as I can tell you cannot).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The painting is from when I used to record art lessons and post them online&amp;hellip; I think I did about 100 episodes, under the title &amp;ldquo;Painting in Five&amp;rdquo;. This particular one was showing how to paint out a rough sketch, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite certain it was based off of the lion from the MCM Grand. At any rate, the idea was to just show people how to quickly get some things down without thinking too much about whether it was good or bad. And now&amp;hellip; about twenty years later, I am doing a track a day just to get myself to put something down. Maybe I should bring back the &amp;ldquo;In Five&amp;rdquo; concept in the blog? I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about it, but haven&amp;rsquo;t committed to anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 20 and I just went for more ambient&amp;hellip; so veg out a bit and see where it takes you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my back yard. Well I sold my house, so technically now it is the new owner&amp;rsquo;s back yard, but I am currently still living here. Setup a lease back arrangement while I am waiting on the new place. About a month to a month and a half to go&amp;hellip; and believe me, I am ready&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s about time to get my damn music studio back together so I can get access to sounds that I want when I want them. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s been quite nice to be working with a greatly reduced set of sound sources&amp;hellip; so it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been an issue by any stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over at MPC Forums &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;amp;u=105910&#34;&gt;Monstre Sensible&lt;/a&gt; kicked off a thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=209558&#34;&gt;Export Song&lt;/a&gt;. A key question asked what happens to audio over the 0db mark, and if this could be considered headroom. I was ready with the &amp;ldquo;here is the manual page&amp;rdquo; to describe the behavior, but Akai didn&amp;rsquo;t actually document what happens in the manual. So&amp;hellip; time to get some scientific experiments started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response I setup a little test, using a normalized single cycle loop, and hooked it up to my Eurorack oscilloscope so I could see what was happening. In theory, this should determine if we have digital distortion in the MPC Live/X/One on the Channel Volume or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a game of air hockey with my daughter from years ago. Something we used to do a lot at the local kid casino&amp;hellip; but she is too old for that now :D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track was made using drums from MPC Tutor&amp;rsquo;s latest drum kit&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-samples.com/product.php/315/the-underground-crates/&#34;&gt;The Underground Crates&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for some new drums definitely check it out. I&amp;rsquo;m digging this MPC Expansion so far, and can see it having a lot of mileage. The rest of the track is just a chopped up bass and chopped up guitar sample. Nothing too exciting&amp;hellip; and I had a vocal track with it, but it was just too much. I ended up just going for keeping this track simple and chilled out today&amp;hellip; so it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly special&amp;hellip; but I really liked how chilled out and fun it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Picture is from my dog Amy&amp;hellip; she was totally chilling the other day. Well, honestly, she chills every day! That&amp;rsquo;s her secret, she&amp;rsquo;s always relaxed. Except when the wind is blowing leaves around&amp;hellip; then she&amp;rsquo;s full attack mode. Other than that though, she&amp;rsquo;s conserving her energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you folks out there not making stuff&amp;hellip; whether it is dope or whack&amp;hellip; come on&amp;hellip; get yourself out there! I&amp;rsquo;m definitely hearing some great stuff coming from folks just trying to put things down, but there&amp;rsquo;s quite a few peeps with a lot of gear just sitting on their laurels. Get your freak on and put something together!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from a painting I did years ago&amp;hellip; I think I gave it to my mom? *shrug*&amp;hellip; somebody probably still has it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track came together pretty fast. I started with a pretty basic drum beat and bass line, and tweaked the FX, pitch, etc&amp;hellip; a bit to get a bit more of an interesting sound. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I added in the piano. This is just a chopped up loop, and I decided to do something different, and work on make a 32 bar playing of the chops, instead of doing my usual 4 or 8 bar play through and then working with the loops. I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to consider this in the future, as it was both fun to see different ways I could utilize the sample, but I also got a few interesting places I normally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 16&amp;hellip; it may be cold outside but it is getting warm in here&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/almost-there&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/almost-there&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is a chocolate cake we had for Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day&amp;hellip; really good&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure my wife picked it up at Whole Foods&amp;hellip; if I remember correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the track it&amp;rsquo;s another mix of chops and synths&amp;hellip; and auto sampling&amp;hellip; and mistakes. I spent a lot of time looking for sounds that I felt would work together, so this track feels pretty good. Normally I&amp;rsquo;d upload the auto sampled synth&amp;hellip; but it has echo in it&amp;hellip; making me have to record every single note for the group, and then this makes it hard to use outside of a 96bpm standpoint&amp;hellip; as well&amp;hellip; it also only works for the notes I sampled which&amp;hellip; put it in the rather not so useful category for a general standpoint. I may try and find a good delay/reverb match to make it into a generic MPC patch&amp;hellip; but for now it just felt kind of strange to upload something so rigid and honestly kind of single purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fifteen tracks for January&amp;hellip; woo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture&amp;hellip; I believe is from Disney, from the animal park resort. I am pretty sure I mentioned how much my daughter loved that trip. We had a blast, and it was great to see all of the different animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track is a mix of chops, and synths. I started by chopping up a break, and then moved on to finding some guitar sounds to fill out some of what I thought was going to be a lead and the bass&amp;hellip; but well&amp;hellip; the bass sound was decidedly not inspiring&amp;hellip; and I kind of drowned up the guitar sound in a lot of this track with some of the synths (whoops). So not the end of the world, and something that could be patched up with some mixing, but my intent here was to work on keeping things in key, or as in key as I could without totally knowing what I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from ages ago when we took my daughter to the Friendly Farm to see some animals when she was a toddler I think&amp;hellip; the FX may make the bunny look like it is taking off&amp;hellip; but if we&amp;rsquo;re being real, it was just laying on some concrete and could not care about us. We had no food, so the meat bags weren&amp;rsquo;t of any importance to it :D. Miss the days when she was excited to spend time with me, but now that she&amp;rsquo;s a teenager, well&amp;hellip; she&amp;rsquo;s got other interests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I tried to slow the track down here&amp;hellip; and&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; I kind of like the sound of it, but you can tell just listening to it I drifted off into some mental space that wasn&amp;rsquo;t so focussed on the track&amp;hellip; I suspect this is what happens for creating a new track a day for a month and a half. I wanted to like it, and I wanted to feel like I was being productive, but instead I felt like I was just slamming content together. Worse, this was me just chopping loops up&amp;hellip; which normally I dig, but I think being the first day back to work, I just kind of got &amp;lsquo;meh&amp;rsquo; about it. Oh well&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s another three weeks to go of this?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from one of my trips to the Czech Republic&amp;hellip; forget when&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a lot of stunning architecture out there, and absolutely worth checking out. About a third of the organization that I used to manage was out there, so I&amp;rsquo;d probably be out there two to three times a year to check in on everybody, see how things were going, get feedback, and make sure the the remote team members knew that I was a living and breathing human being.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The image is from a trip years ago that we took our daughter to the Boston Commons and is of the paddle boat that you can take a little tour around the duck pond. Our daughter was never super excited to get on the boat, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure we ever did at that age, now she&amp;rsquo;s probably too old to think it would be something fun to do. Honestly, having done the ride before myself, it&amp;rsquo;s a little pricey, and you don&amp;rsquo;t really get too much excitement out of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Boy, the picture is from about four years ago&amp;hellip; Amy is looking impressively squinty&amp;hellip; might have been from the flash, I don&amp;rsquo;t really recall. Looked like a goofy enough picture to work with for today&amp;rsquo;s track though. She&amp;rsquo;s watching you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I took my own personal advice from yesterday and only applied transposes to the track level, and not the sequence level of the song. I figured that way I&amp;rsquo;m not having drums hop all over the place and can have some more control over what is going on. It was a little bit more work, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=1654</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The track was named as such&amp;hellip; because I threw my hands up in desperation. *not* a good track, but I did learn something&amp;hellip; but first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-time-here-is-done&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-time-here-is-done&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the picture comes courtesy of the dang thing that the MPC Live did to twist up my song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/f7a5f8df-cb19-42c9-b42a-304d5e1d45a1%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=1024&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, above is the drum track&amp;hellip; but let me explain how I got there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I would play around with transpose on sequence mode&amp;hellip; just do a pattern of I/IV/I/V&amp;hellip; (or no semitone offset, +4 semitone offset, no semitone offset, +5 semitone offset). With me so far? I basically just copied my main sequence twice, second sequence I put a +4 semitone transpose on the sequence, and for the third sequence I put a +5 semitone transpose on the sequence. I then went to song mode and just did the pattern Seq 1, Seq 2, Seq 3, Seq 4&amp;hellip; and then converted the whole thing back into a sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Putting this track together was fun&amp;hellip; but I did struggle a bit (again) with audio tracks, external midi, and exporting the file. I know I grumbled about this before, but Akai really needs to get an ability to mix in from the inputs for a track if/when you need to. I suppose posting everything to audio tracks is fine, but the workflow is just wonky to me. I&amp;rsquo;ll quit my belly aching on it, but it did lead to a bit of a mess uploading a track that was missing a core synth part. On the pro soundcloud account it&amp;rsquo;s not a *huge* problem to replace a track, but boy was it funny to go back and listen to the track and notice it was missing. It&amp;rsquo;s something I can fix in my on process for creating and publishing songs, but&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a hassle. Also&amp;hellip; to be fair, even if there was a checkbox to use external gear to get it in from the inputs I&amp;rsquo;d probably still complain about it being a problem because then I&amp;rsquo;d probably double up sounds, or cause myself other problems. Maybe it is fine Akai? Maybe! This is just something that&amp;rsquo;s been such an ingrained workflow in DAWs though, that it does lead me to at least one area where the MPC in standalone isn&amp;rsquo;t quite enough as a DAW. Everything inside the box it is cool, but exporting out content it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work quite so hot. /grumbling off&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from some resin structures we made as a family this year. My dad was all about how copper killed COVID or something silly, so he sent us some. I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy into it, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think he did either, but we ended up all doing remote family molds to just try and make something interesting. I had never poured resin like this before, so it was interesting at least to see the process up close and personal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from a Barnum and Bailey Circus show that we brought our daughter to. She loved it. Definitely was weird though&amp;hellip; we were near the front of the stadium and these massive and majestic creatures still looked so small. We offered our daughter to go see them up close after the show, but I think she was three at the time and was terrified to get anywhere near them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I rolled this track together in what&amp;hellip; less than an hour I think? I just did lazy/manual chops by playing the track and tapping out the pads&amp;hellip; I know it&amp;rsquo;s a bit sloppy, but honestly it sounded fine, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking to make a masterpiece. From there I knocked out a bit of drums to just have something to flip to, and was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from a trip to Disney World that my wife and I took our daughter to for her third birthday. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember the trip at all today, but at the time she had a blast. When she was younger she was quite a clingy kid, and I can still remember how sore my shoulders were because she refused to walk anywhere and instead wanted to ride on my shoulders for the entire trip. Do not recommend&amp;hellip; the shoulder part&amp;hellip; the Disney trip was great :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The image comes courtesy of one of my wife&amp;rsquo;s trips to New York City with her friends years ago. I repurposed it for my track&amp;hellip; hopefully she doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned yesterday that I started working on this track yesterday right after throwing in the towel for day two, and I really dig how this track came out. I decided to keep the flow super short, so it is just a Main section, Drop section, and Outro section&amp;hellip; so absolutely nothing fancy, but I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it needed much else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my daughter finding a frog in the backyard over the summer and we caught a few pictures of it. She was super excited to have found such a small critter hanging out in the back yard and just wanted to get a few close ups of the little guy (or gal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fiddled with this track a bit throughout the day and it never quite came together the way I wanted. I tried to play everything out by hand as much as possible, and well&amp;hellip; I find it okay. The transitions between sections are particularly week again, and I know I could have done better to build up more energy if I had just had the time. Instead I decided to cut my losses on this track and move forward to preparing for day three instead&amp;hellip; which meant this track suffered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;First off, the picture is of my oldest dog, Amy (pronounced Emmy). I was trying to find a picture that might feel a little dreamy, where you might not quite know what was going on, was maybe a little shocking, but not really in the terrifying space. This was a picture from taking Amy home from being spayed, and we had to put the cone on her head to keep her from licking the wound. She is by no means intimidating, and is actually one of the sweetest dogs you could find, but this picture does make her look a little haunted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I just wrapped up putting together a track a day, no matter how good or bad, and posting *something* daily over the month of December. My goal was to do all of the production on the MPC Live mk2, and just push content to a coherent enough thought or conclusion without necessarily worrying about all of the bells and whistles. Sampling sources, expansion packs, completing old incomplete tracks, that was all on the table for me throughout December.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s to slugging out the last track for December, and heading into the new year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ninth-circle&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ninth-circle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This track came about from creating an audio track from a 32 bar loop on the Access Virus TI2 Darkstar. I automated a few parameters and figured it sound cool enough to add some drums and FX to it. I wanted to try and get something slower and more droning this time around, instead of some of the faster and more manic tracks I have been laying down the last month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So this track has several key groups that I auto sampled off of both my Access Virus TI2 Darkstar and Waldorf Iridium. I figured I&amp;rsquo;d upload the patches for those interested or who are just looking for some synth sounds to play with&amp;hellip; so you can get them below. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother trimming anything&amp;hellip; so the file is a bit large&amp;hellip; but go nuts and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Picture comes courtesy of a sunset in Aruba from a couple years back. Took the family to go see the island, and we all had a blast. Heck even got my wife into the ocean for a little bit, despite her being completely afraid to hop into water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the notes I played around with Orb Composer a bit in order to come up with note progressions for Arp/Bass/Chord/Melody&amp;hellip; The key is Ab, Major scale with a chord progression of i-iv-vii-II, or Abmb7/Eb, Dbm/Ab, Gbmb7, and Bbb/Fb. I tried to use the MPC Live Performance Pads to operate in the correct scale&amp;hellip; maybe it worked? I didn&amp;rsquo;t play out too much live so it isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly like it probably mattered much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie to you folks&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a lot of back to back to back tracks for me, and I am kind of looking forward to the month ending so I can get into a different musical head space. This was just a straight up Expansion Pack kit that I loaded up, and then added a bit more to it with some samples from my brand spanking new Waldorf Iridium. I was more into just playing with the Iridium than making a track, but figured I needed to get moving and actually put something together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not what I had intended to create&amp;hellip; but that seems to be par for the course for trying to do a track a day :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/emotional-adjustment&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/emotional-adjustment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent for this track was to put some content together in Reason and then make some create patterns that changed chord structures throughout the song. Started off good, made a bunch of chords, arpeggios, and bass lines to flow in a Bb Minor&amp;hellip; chord progression of I-VII-v-ii&amp;hellip; resulting in Bbmb7, AbM7, Fm/Ab, Cmb7&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was struggling to pull anything together for day 26. I started a bunch of tracks but nothing really grabbed me. Must be a downer from all the excitement from Christmas. *shrug*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/a-grave-decision&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/a-grave-decision&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I was just pulling things together randomly&amp;hellip; and then when I&amp;rsquo;d start to track out different sections nothing felt like it felt like it worked together. Heck, I removed half of this track because it just didn&amp;rsquo;t sit in place correctly and the transitions were quite jarring. It is possible that I am just getting tired of making a track a day, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s just the mood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=1500</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t any other entries, so I figured what the heck and put together a track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample itself was pretty basic, so I figured I would work on chopping it up and just finding a drum kit to play to it. I wanted to focus as much as possible on keeping the original audio track playing throughout the track without it sounding too repetitive, this meant making variations to work through, and seeing what worked. Ultimately I wanted some of the shorter chops to play longer through this process, so a quick detune of 6 semitones had me pretty well sorted so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any gaps of silence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is another track that I tried to go for a more minimal sound, and it was made up of only three loops. I know the track itself is not very complex or technical, but I worked on making up for it by making a few variations of each loop to get some variety in the flips. Given that I am still doing a new track a day, and time has been at a premium, this gave me a bit more time to be picky on the loops that I chose to work with in order to put the track together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I put this track together from just three samples&amp;hellip; a drum break&amp;hellip; an acoustic bass&amp;hellip; and a piano melody. Nothing too fancy, but I wanted to spend the time today making different patterns from the different samples and then mixing it up and seeing how it came together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly stoked by the track itself, but it does feel like it is worth taking the time to make a few change ups this way, even if I&amp;rsquo;m limited to doing a track a day. Honestly, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much more work, and I think where the results worked&amp;hellip; well they did work out well. It&amp;rsquo;s just that I need to make the time to do it. Normally for these daily tracks I have been trying to just get one 4 or 8 bar chunk sounding &amp;ldquo;just right&amp;rdquo;, but then I end up trying to make it sound interesting by dropping sections, building, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well this one was a bit more of a pain to get started. I have had a mild headache most of the day and just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to put any energy into making a track&amp;hellip; however the show must go on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is courtesy of my basement&amp;hellip; and the dead spider is courtesy of the glass apparently trapping it in. I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what made me think of the picture or the title for the track, but somehow they are now linked in my brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of a trip to Munich. Not so much a tourist type of city, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to see there. I think that particular shot came from a train ride that I took with my family to go check out the Olympic Stadium out there. It was interesting to see, but kind of sad at the same time to see something that had so much funding and investment put into it that ended up not being kept up and maintained as much as you&amp;rsquo;d hope. I suspect that a lot of the Olympic areas around the world are like this, and I suppose when things get back to normal I will have to travel around to check out more for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from my trip to Athens Greece with some filters on it. Nothing fancy, but the statue was incredible to see in person. It&amp;rsquo;s made out of plexiglass or glass and stacked up to look like a person. We walked by the statue quite a bit for our family trip, and would definitely go there again!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today I went back to the now &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; standard of making some loops in Reason Studio, working on some sound design to get some interesting sounds, and then bouncing the loops out to be chopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things I tried to switch it up. First, I made four bar loops, but extended them out to eight bars, because I wanted the ambience to flow through to the start of the first bar, instead of hearing the loop in the first bar kind of catch up. Something sounds a bit off&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s possible that I have an LFO that is not sync&amp;rsquo;d to the track, or maybe my copy/paste of notes was bad. I tried it&amp;hellip; and while it didn&amp;rsquo;t work quite how I wanted, well&amp;hellip; it still produced results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth day is upon me&amp;hellip; and I called &amp;ldquo;Sudden Death&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-death&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is in fact no death, but I named it as such because I really don&amp;rsquo;t have much time left for the rest of the day, and had to pull something together in about 30 minutes. So instead of doing sound design in reason, today I just loaded up a pre-made drum kit&amp;hellip; from &amp;lsquo;LoFi Soul and Future Beats&amp;rsquo; and just went to town to knock it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eighteen days, it&amp;rsquo;s been eighteen days, dropping a beat every day, so many ways&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This track&amp;hellip; I am still making loops in Reason Studio and looping them&amp;hellip; this might be the last one for the month&amp;hellip; not because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the results, but just so I can experiment with some other track making techniques&amp;hellip; or who knows&amp;hellip; go back to finishing off some older tracks. The next few days we shall see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I just like this track&amp;hellip; guess I have nothing else to say about it today :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; I was being lazy yesterday&amp;hellip; cleaning up after the blizzard kind of got to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this track I really decided to pair down the frantic energy and focus a bit more on natural sounding instruments with some air, space, and environment to them. As I said yesterday, I am quite happy about how it came out, though mixing was a bit of a pain due to how different the levels were on all of the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sixteen days feels like more time making a track a day than it really is :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/yeeting-it&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/yeeting-it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of my wife&amp;rsquo;s hand while we were visiting in Bangalore last year and she asked to get some Henna artwork done on her hand. Had a great time out there and would love to go back. The food was incredible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the track, probably approaching the last days during this month of pulling content off of Reason Studio daily and then chopping up loops for inspiration, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking around for another sound source or two for the month just to push myself in other directions. I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to do some sound recording, and who knows, maybe I go industrial?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I am still having a blast making loops in Reason and exporting it out to the MPC for chopping up. This track had a lot going on with it, and I had fun making the initial four bars&amp;hellip; but once I got started tracking it out into a song things really went sideways. The transitions just didn&amp;rsquo;t work and the track started to fall apart. I think it was more a case of a few different sounds just not supporting each other very well and while I was having fun making the four bar loop it wasn&amp;rsquo;t obvious, but when trying to put transitions together it became a bit jarring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track needed some mixing love, I tried to nail it, but I still think the saw synth is a bit intense. Perhaps this is what the track needed? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. After this many tracks can I really be sure of anything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am sure that all of the content was yet again produced in Reason Studio, and I ran it through the Yorgos Arabatzsis Mastering. I&amp;rsquo;m getting a bit more of a handle with both making loops in Reason Studio 11, and working with YAM to get the sounds I am looking for, and pushing the sounds I don&amp;rsquo;t like back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is another track that I spent some time putting together four bar loops in Reason Studio 11 in order to get some content that I could chop up and mangle in the MPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything too special about the chops, but the bass line was played out a bit wonky to start, and I just kind of went with it. The first two bars are super simple, and then the last two bars get a lot more complex. From there, I built a lot of the melody and chords around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track was a ton of fun to put together. I wanted to change my perspective on making tracks this month, and decided to focus on chopping up samples, but 100% making my own content. So this project started as a deep dive into Reason Studio 11 to really really really get into some sound design. I knew I wanted to go glitchy and spacey, and I think I pretty well delivered on those themes in this track. So all drum patterns, loops, everything were initially created in a 30 minute session in Reason, and then I bounced and exported six tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another attempt at just using the built in instruments on the Akai MPC Live&amp;hellip; and yeah&amp;hellip; I guess as an easy listening track it is okay? Not much to say today&amp;hellip; I think making all of these tracks back to back is slowly driving me to madness. The last two days have felt like pretty hard flops for what I am trying to do, but seriously, this is how you learn. I will keep pushing ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/trapped-in&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/trapped-in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was digging through some more old tracks I had put together, and wanted to wrap this up. I sampled off the piano through CBA Generation Loss a year ago, and just really dug the sound of it. When I stumbled upon the track I just kept thinking, you know&amp;hellip; I need to make something of this..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly though, I am not really happy with how it all came together. I think I tried too hard, and it&amp;rsquo;s kind of hot garbage. I definitely spent too much time working on it and just not feeling the vibe I had been hoping to go for, and ultimately it just didn&amp;rsquo;t really come together into something that I can smile at. Even just going back and listening to it again I have to give it a thumbs down. Not my best work, but we&amp;rsquo;ve all got to start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track was put together using only the plugins and fx available from the MPC Live in standalone mode, so no samples, loops, or any other audio content. I wanted to see what I could put together using the new drum machine, electric, tube, and bass plugins to put something together. A few of the tracks I really drizzled on the delay and feedback, and I tossed a gated filter for good measure. So, today was the creation of a totally new beat out of the box, and just seeing where it would take me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well I am certainly embarrassed. Instead of going through &amp;ldquo;weeks old&amp;rdquo; tracks, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d dig deep and see what gems might be out there that are a year or more old&amp;hellip; and I found this little number. Out of the box it was nearly ready to go, and for the life of me I could not tell you why I never got around to just putting a bow on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a picture of my house when I first bought it. My daughter used to call it potato brown. My wife and I have done so much work on this place over the years, and are in the process of moving into another house. I&amp;rsquo;ll miss this house, but it was my first house, and it&amp;rsquo;ll hold a special place for me and my family!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to day numero six. I started this little number about two weeks ago&amp;hellip; just before I wanted to try and put out a track a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/powerful-feeling&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/powerful-feeling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is&amp;hellip; probably eight years old now? There were some monks making mandalas in my home town and I have some interesting videos of the work they did. The level of concentration is impressive to put together these images, and you can see they are using masks to make sure the do not disturb the sand while they are making the picture. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty cool process, and it was fun to watch. My daughter got a kick out of it, and I have a video where one of the monks helped her make her own tiny image out of sand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The painting is a water color that I did years ago&amp;hellip; probably over fifteen years ago. I happened to find it while going through my old notebooks looking for some blank paper. It&amp;rsquo;s not that great, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the other side to do some paintings for a project I am working on with my sister. So long sort of interesting tree and wild&amp;hellip; what is that&amp;hellip; a sunset?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I did some prep last night chopping and getting some drum tracks down, but this is an entirely new track, so nothing pulled from the old archives of unfinished tracks past. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure how much time I&amp;rsquo;d have today. This lead into some discovery of just loading up loops, chopping them and seeing what I could throw against the wall to stick.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This started as a four bar loop about two or three weeks ago on my Akai MPC Live mk2, and I just left the main loop running for like an hour and didn&amp;rsquo;t get sick of it. The drums were all on the same track and I did need to separate those out, but beyond that I had a good enough mind to keep the bass, wurli, and sitar sounds on their own tracks, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t overwhelming to dig in and actually start making different sections of the song.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track was something I had just made a two bar section&amp;hellip; and really liked it a month or so back, but just didn&amp;rsquo;t really know where to go with it. In order to complete my track a day I figured it is completely fine to dig up old material and put it together. This is another track done entirely on the Akai MPC mk2, and this time no fun mastering. It&amp;rsquo;s mixed closer to the way I wanted it, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel it needed any oomph to the track, though I say that and have re-listened to it a few times and kind of question my decision. It might&amp;rsquo;ve benefited from another round of processing, but hey gotta keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just a lofi track to relax to. Yeah I know it&amp;rsquo;s kind of noisy&amp;hellip; as the lofi folks like? A lot of vinyl, tape, and other random clicks and clacks. All done on the MPC Live mk2. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably keep all of the tracks done through the MPC Live mk2 this month just to really dig into it a bit more and see if 2.9 has either weird workflow bugs I trip over or things that get me to think about working on the tracks differently inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Got some more S950 programs sampled, but first, here&amp;rsquo;s the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v4.zip&#34;&gt;NT - S950 v4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v4.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing I learned this time around was that from the Sampler menu, if you select a mono source and set the sampling to mono&amp;hellip; well I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to use Fission to covert the samples to mono. That saved some headaches for sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall notes for the auto sampling:&lt;br&gt;
\* 430 Mono samples&lt;br&gt;
\* Should play from C-2 to G8&lt;br&gt;
\* Sampled C0 to C5 in most cases, with a stride of 4&lt;br&gt;
\* Generally 16 samples per program&lt;br&gt;
\* Only one Sample Layer at velocity of 127&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A conversation started on MPC Forums about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;amp;t=206423&#34;&gt;MPC &amp;amp; S900/950 Routing Question&lt;/a&gt;. We got into details about how the S900/S950 worked, which then lead into S900/S950 samples sounding more full on the S1000 and later. I ended up taking a stab at sampling both white noise and a drum break on the S950 with a bandwidth of 3000 and 19200, and then playing the notes across the key group to get some samples together. Below is the project and recordings from the S950 and S1000 for your own listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MPC Programs - NT S950 Volume 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back at it for another round of sampling off of my trusty Akai S950&amp;hellip; still working like a champ. Before getting into the details, here&amp;rsquo;s the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v3-1.zip&#34;&gt;NT - S950 v3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v3-1.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news is that I am getting faster at sampling, but the bad news is that I made a mistake on a few of the programs and called them S95 instead of S950. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t too big of a deal since the .xpm files are text editable since they are in a human readable format, but it was a bit of a chore to rename all of the samples, edit the file to do a search and replace of S95 to S950, and then hope everything worked out okay. Still, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t so bad, and I have gotten some more samples together for your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MPC Samples - NT S950 Volume 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I spent about six hours yesterday recording off samples from my Akai S950, and auto sampling them into my MPC Live mk2. Near the end I think I was starting to get cross eyed. Anyway, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, I have posted the samples below, and then will get into the details after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v1.zip&#34;&gt;NT - S950 v1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v1.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is MPC X/Live/One formatted&amp;hellip; though the samples are 44.1k/16-bit mono, so should load into plenty of samplers. I considered converting this stack into a MPC Expansion, but gave up on the app for now. Maybe later, when I figure out the steps to create previews&amp;hellip; and apparently it wants sequences for each program *shrug*. I watched a few videos on YouTube, and read Tutor&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-tutor.com/mpc-expansion-packs-complete-guide/&#34;&gt;Complete Guide to MPC Expansion Packs&lt;/a&gt; but got the impression that you might need to use the MPC Software in order to do some of these things more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track I threw together for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=204552&#34;&gt;MPC Forums Beat Battle #293&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s still open if you wanted to check it out and post up your own take. The sample to flip this time around is Brenton Wood &amp;ldquo;Trouble&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I just loaded the track into the MPC Live, set it to chop on transients with a setting of 50, and then just started looking for samples I thought sounded cool. Was this lazy? Probably, but for this beat battle I wanted to force myself outside of the mindset of using perfect loops, and some of those transients were janky as heck, making me think way outside of the box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to do something kind of epic, kind of 8-bit, and kind of fun&amp;hellip; hopefully this track hits those beats for you. All of the tracks were done on the MPC Live mk2, and I exported the stems for arrangement out in Ableton Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most abusive thing I did was decimating that clap hit into a bit crunched bunch of noise, the rest was pretty standard flare, with maybe a bit of automation thrown in for effect just to give the track some movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I put this track together last week for the MPC BB 292, and then forgot to post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first trick, to get the really over cooked sound from the track, I ended up pitching the track up 3 octaves before playing it, and then sampled it into my Akai S950. This really stripped away a lot of the high end information, but also made the low end quite a bit punchier to my ears. Initially I pitched it up so much because I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have the sample time to record a nearly 6 minute song into the roughly 23 seconds of sample time&amp;hellip; and pitching the content up so extremely really let me squeeze it all in there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I just picked up the Cooper FX: Arcade&amp;hellip; and have been putting several of the cards through their paces to see what kinds of sounds I can get out of them. So far, enjoying the tape effects, lofi effects, and getting some quite interesting distortion. Definitely feels like a pedal I can take on the road with me without needing to lug around a huge pedal board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hook it up, I have really just setup output 3 on the Live routed into the Arcade input, and the output of the Arcade is going back into the Live&amp;rsquo;s In one. Honestly, nothing too fancy yet, heck I haven&amp;rsquo;t even tried to use CC or midi between the two devices yet to control the FX parameters, but that&amp;rsquo;ll be coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Another STBB track! We had three tracks to work with this week, and I pulled a little something from all of the tracks. I mostly focussed on trying to sculpt the sounds with some filter to give everything a bit of room. The only sample I pulled from externally was a drum loop that I chopped up to give the drums a bit more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely spent more time on this track than I meant to, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t come out as great as I had hoped, but it still sounds kind of fun. Probably got to get back to vocals in STBB tracks if I want to have a chance at competing over there though :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recorded off some of the sounds that I used on the OP-1 as key groups into the MPC Live mk2. They are not going to sound exactly the same, but it should be pretty close. Definitely go into the key group and change the release to taste, as I pretty much left them as defaults, so it&amp;rsquo;ll be a pretty abrupt end of the samples as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this track together for MPC Forums BB #290. It was a quick flip on the MPC Live mk2&amp;hellip; and although I did a lot of chopping, I literally just went with the loop that I pulled and then just dropped percussion all around it. There isn&amp;rsquo;t too much to say about this because it just went fast. Sometimes the simplest flips work best :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I just got kind of into the dark vibe of the sounds after pitching things down. I suspect the vocals are take it or leave it&amp;hellip; and I definitely could have cleaned them up a bit. I guess it could come across as some mumbling or something, but that wasn&amp;rsquo;t my intent. I also think the clickers are a bit too loud and probably could have used some filtering. Ah well&amp;hellip; this was another quick one to pull together. It feels looser because of it, but there is something for me here to just keep knocking these things out quickly instead of getting so stuck in my head making the tracks, especially for BBs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track&amp;hellip; well the rule was to use the sample&amp;hellip; and do something outside your comfort zone. I rarely put any kind of silence in my track, so I wanted to force myself to have breaks throughout the song, but have it sound as natural as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the track was put together on the MPC Live mk2, but I also did load the finished track into Ableton Live for some further poking and prodding. The middle section that kind of functions as a drop, and the outro were both done in Ableton. I figured it was a short enough track, but needed something to mix it up a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A bit of a scramble this one&amp;hellip; but had fun listening to the song and picking out the parts I liked. All done on the MPC Live mk2&amp;hellip; only software intervention was to load Fission so I could just cut the track to length and do a quick fade out. I promise :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around I tried to create 3 different main sections, and then worked through drops, buildups and such to get the track together. Then just strung them together in song mode. It was a bit of a hassle because I exploded a few too many tracks in spots, and then from section to section they didn&amp;rsquo;t line up&amp;hellip; add to this that I did not name any of the tracks properly, and it made for a bit more confusion trying to create various sections. Worked out pretty quickly though, I&amp;rsquo;d say this track came together in two hours max.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track has been a bit of a labor of love&amp;hellip; haha. I decided to jump into the next challenge for Electro Funk, and was listening to a lot of tracks from the era. If you want to check out the main post on MPC Forums for the Electro Funk Challenge, well go on over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=200241&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Been a lot of discussion again, and I think it was the third page I dropped a number of YouTube videos, most of which are in the right style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ll kick off first and foremost, this entire track was done on the MPC Live mk2.  Not for any particular reason, but I started there, and just kept going.  Being able to unplug the device while taking my daughter out to ballet, horseback riding, waiting for my wife to finish shopping… whatever it was, was certainly helpful.  Besides auto sampling a few synths, everything was done in the box including fx, mixing, mastering, all that.  I know a lot of folks know it is possible, but for those who doubt it, maybe this changes your mind?  I actually expected a few times to want to be reaching for Ableton, Reason, or Melodyne to do a few things, but that was frequently when I was away from my computer and I just pushed my way through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first MPC was the Akai MPC 1k Black. I really cut my teeth on this MPC over the years, and with JJOS it really made the MPC 1k shine. Life was pretty simple, but it had been given an amazing workflow for chopping, sampling, and writing music. I bought it back when the black model was released, and held on to it until just this year. Watching the prices of a lot of the old gear I had sky rocket, it was hard to justify keeping it around, especially since it was living mostly in it&amp;rsquo;s old box. As I&amp;rsquo;ve written about before, I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to keep old gear around for the sake of keeping it, and it was just time to part with the MPC 1k along with a lot of the other gear that has gone out the door, hopefully on to better homes that will appreciate and use the gear to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This track is done from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=734&#34;&gt;STBB Forever #699&lt;/a&gt; Beat Battle. I used the tracks provided, as well as a track that I did years ago to jam these tracks together. It is not a great track, and more just playing around. The rules were to use the provided samples, a beep, vocal or bleep track or whatever, and you could use outside sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I had the idea to do a beat and then transition into a DnB/Jungle type of track&amp;hellip; but I did it. Results were not so great though. It leaves for an awkward transition, and the second half only really hits the rules because I had a computerized vocal &amp;ldquo;beep&amp;rdquo; sound in it. So, uhm&amp;hellip; I guess points for &amp;ldquo;creativity&amp;rdquo; maybe? But for actual execution this is kind of hot garbage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I won last week&amp;rsquo;s Beat Battle and got to pick the rules and the sample. The sample I went for is Miles Davis - So What.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules I went for were any external sounds allowed, but you have to sample whatever you want to add from a microphone. No mic simulations allowed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;As I said in the previous post, this track had to come together quite quickly&amp;hellip; and this is maybe at best an hour worth of work. I scrambled to get it together and then added some decorative vocals and a baseline to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness this track is a bit over compressed, you can hear it especially when the hi hats slam into the available headroom. I guess I got too carried away with everything in the short amount of time&amp;hellip; but I got what I got :D.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty then! So for this track, I started it and finished it in about 30 minutes. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to hit the deadline yesterday&amp;hellip; and figured I&amp;rsquo;d just cut to the chase for the throw down. To pull this together I just grabbed a four bar section that I liked the sound of, chopped it, pitched it down, and then got to business laying out a track. I then searched through drums and kits to piece together something for drums, a little fx, and some bass that was halfway decent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - MPCBB #284 - Just Stop</title>

&lt;p&gt;Well this was a super quick flip of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=199354&amp;amp;p=1800618#p1800618&#34;&gt;MPC Forums BB #284&lt;/a&gt;, and when I say quick I mean I did this in about 30 minutes. This was entirely an exercise to force myself to get it completed, since I am kind of running out of time, and I wanted to see where I could go if I just unrealistically restricted myself. My primary goal was to make sure that I wanted to limit the number of takes I did to put this together, and figure out how to glue it together in a way that it would sound coherent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Chest Pain</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/07/10/track-chest-pain/</link>

&lt;p&gt;This track came together pretty quickly. Maybe two hours of goofing around on the MPC Live mk2 at most. The core of it started with me patching on my modular system, and seeing what tones I could create, and then sync&amp;rsquo;ing that to the MPC Live mk2 over CV&amp;hellip; well technically gate signals. You can see from the picture that this is honestly not a terribly complicated patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8bad7823-6b1f-479f-b535-ad0aeb3ee990%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=883&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This patch is what is making that sometimes bass, sometimes bloopy sound in the track. Effectively Tempi is being clocked by the MPC Live mk2 gate out, which is then clocking the Wogglebug, Brains, and a strike on the RxMx. DPO is doing the oscillator duties today, and being run into the FxDF 6db slope that is then patched into RxMx. In turn, RxMx is being filtered by the QPAS which is then going to the output. Of note, Pressure Points/Brains is being used to modulate the 1v/octave to generate the change in tones, as well as the left !! on QPAS, and the Wogglebug step modulation is driving the QPAS filter changes. I went this way to create a fair mix of &amp;ldquo;in control&amp;rdquo; and somewhat random modulation, which I recorded in as an eight bar loop in the MPC Live mk2 Looper.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a track I have been working on for about a week on the PO-33. All the sampling and mixing was done within the little box. I continue to like this little device because it really forces you to think about a potentially crippling amount of sampling time and a very real four note polyphony limit. Some of the previous tracks I have done really ran into the polyphony wall, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly drop notes the way I would expect at least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This picture comes courtesy of Photoshop Camera on the iPhone with one of the goofy filters. I was out RV&amp;rsquo;ing with my family and my parents for a couple of days over the weekend&amp;hellip; which held me up from having time to pull together more of a track. I was split on the track this week, and was messing around on Sunday afternoon on the MPC, and the yesterday I flipped to try to put a track together on the PO-33.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - STBB Forever BB 693</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I rushed my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt; beat battle submission, and ended up deciding to post a track to &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/index.php&#34;&gt;STBB Forever&lt;/a&gt; this time. Not sure that I&amp;rsquo;ll dive deep into the STBB community and beat battles or not, but it&amp;rsquo;s fun to find some other communities and see what may or may not stick with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;amp;t=674&#34;&gt;STBB #693&lt;/a&gt; track, there was a *lot* of content to parse through, and there was a lot that would absolutely trip up on a submission to YouTube or Soundcloud. So, who knows how long my submission will last, but it is posted for now. The rules were pretty simple, use something from every track, no snares on 2 or 4, and something about being able to used instruments, but no sampled melodic content. I decided to just use all of the content just from the tracks, that&amp;rsquo;s been most of my style lately, and it makes it more of a fun challenge to see what you can squeeze out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai MPC Live mk2 / One CV outs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, and looking to integrate CV output from your MPC so that you can track out gate and CV to devices that will take CV input, you&amp;rsquo;ll find a difference from the MPC X to the MPC Live mk2 / One. On the MPC X, it has eight discrete CV output jacks, so you can connect a TS 1/8&amp;quot; cable to the jack to each of the CV ports for each channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I was going to do a DnB track, but unfortunately pk1 posted one of his own tracks on accident. Sadly, no DnB track dropping for now. Here&amp;rsquo;s the snippet of what I was messing around with in case you are interested. You can see, Amy is super thrilled for being in the picture!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t more than an hour into sampling and chopping, and had just started to sample a few instrument sounds. Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rezo-bass-mpc-x.zip&#34;&gt;Rezo Bass for the MPC X/Live/One&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a bass sound that didn&amp;rsquo;t even make it into the DnB track. I had literally just sampled it and saw the &amp;ldquo;oops&amp;rdquo; post. Anyways&amp;hellip; somewhat of a lost opportunity as I had wanted to do a DnB track for a change, but also figured I had invested enough time and energy and wanted to go a different direction with the next track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
