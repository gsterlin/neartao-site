      <title>MPC Forums OP-1 Question...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;amp;t=201048&amp;amp;start=75&#34;&gt;MPC Forums&lt;/a&gt; Danoc was asking a bit about the OP-1&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s my response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the Teenage Engineering OP-1. It has taken on the status of being an overpriced (released in 2011’ish at about $799 USD, today sells new for $1299 USD which was the latest price hike in 2019) piece of hipster music production hardware. It’s an interesting piece of gear, but isn’t exactly user friendly&amp;hellip; if you want to push yourself to think outside of the box, it has that in spades, but for me it is not a serious piece of music gear in today’s space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my third pass at a Synth Pop track. I did some cool stuff on the MPC Live, but it is definitively not Synth Pop. Something I will absolutely put together as a finished track, but both tracks strayed from the Synth Pop sound way too much, and I decided I&amp;rsquo;d give it one more try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - Sounds of the Old Reliquary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boy, I thought I had posted this track a while ago&amp;hellip; heck I made it nearly a year ago, but here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-sounds-of-the-reliquary&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-sounds-of-the-reliquary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this track together in about an hour, and it was recorded on the Teenage Engineering OP-1 in conjunction with a Bastl Instruments Micro Granny. I spent a lot of time working out sounds to get it fairly noisy, and making it sound like it had some dark, odd vocal sounding components. The Micro Granny provided a lot of the ground work for those sounds, and I then spent some time to find string instruments on the OP-1 and played them at various tape speeds to get a more stretched out sound.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Older Firmware OP-1 Patches</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/06/07/older-firmware-op-1-patches/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking around for something completely different, and happened to stumble upon this Reddit thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/OP1users/comments/5gkx43/download_op1_patches_op1_14203/&#34;&gt;[DOWNLOAD] OP-1 Patches (op1_14203)&lt;/a&gt; which was posted to the OP-1 sub forum for users that wanted access to the older patches provided by the older OP-1 firmware. The direct link is currently still available to a google drive folder that somebody was nice enough too put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6r0Q-Lf6Fe5QVoxV3RBYm5DaFU&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is an interesting find, because it isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy to find the older firmware for devices, and often when you do find the older firmware it is missing a lot of features and functionality to the point of not wanting to downgrade. What is great about these patches is that they are drop in replacements for the OP-1 and gives you some view into what the older firmware was able to do with sampling and the sound engines, without the need to downgrade your device.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Heavens Gate - OP-1 Track</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this audio sitting on my OP-1 for a while (okay two weeks), and while I&amp;rsquo;d like to have sampled and chopped it up some, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d send it out into the universe. I had sent the loops over to my father and brother in-law to see if either of them wanted to try and play some guitar over it. Unfortunately that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Maybe they were too intimidated, I mean this is super awesome! If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in playing around with or adding something to this track, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear it, so link something in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
