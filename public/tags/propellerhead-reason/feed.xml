      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know I haven&amp;rsquo;t usually posted plugins or anything&amp;hellip; and maybe I should&amp;hellip; but sometimes a deal is a deal. Just happened to see this when logging into the Propellerheads site and stumbled upon the shop to see that the Waves H-Comp plugin is currently free at  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/&#34;&gt;https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/&lt;/a&gt; on sale for $49 through August 30th&amp;hellip; and with promo code FREECOMP it is free. Just grabbed it yesterday. I still need to install it and check it out, but hard to pass up a free plugin, especially when it is usually going for $200.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had this audio sitting on my OP-1 for a while (okay two weeks), and while I&amp;rsquo;d like to have sampled and chopped it up some, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d send it out into the universe. I had sent the loops over to my father and brother in-law to see if either of them wanted to try and play some guitar over it. Unfortunately that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Maybe they were too intimidated, I mean this is super awesome! If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in playing around with or adding something to this track, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear it, so link something in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Classy Piano - Akai MPC 1k Program</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well now, this has been sitting in my drafts for way to long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did this even come from? Oh yeah, I made the loop in Reason, using a piano patch&amp;hellip; which one *shrug*, I forget. But I definitely used the Scream FX to add some wow/flutter, how much? I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip; take a listen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apparently the danger I have is not writing enough notes down when I prepare these posts, and I also need to get myself better into the habit of just writing the content of these posts&amp;hellip; below, the next two lines are what I wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
