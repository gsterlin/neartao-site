    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A request over on Reddit came in for some Vinyl Sim Noise recorded off of a 303. Why? I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ but maybe the user will provide some details.
To record this, I just hooked the 303 up to the 404 mk2, turned on the Vinyl Sim on the 303, turned off Compression and Wow, and did a few passes at Volume and Noise levels. After that, did the old record, and then exported to SD. Nothing fancy here‚Ä¶ and with nothing else playing, at high levels it‚Äôs pretty noisy. Didn‚Äôt appear to be clipping on the mk2, so I think these should all be pretty clean‚Ä¶ well as clean as it‚Äôs going to get.

    <p>Not sure why, but this feels like it is in the space of the ‚Äòpeak sound‚Äô I‚Äôve been working towards with this setup. Still a bit noisy and still a bit awkward to control sometimes, but hands on, a bit glitchy, and something that can sustain momentum.
https://youtu.be/t1mUOeepWNw
The track started the day as something happier, but as it wore on, I just kind of went into my own space of wishing, longing, dreaming, but all at a distance with some strange energy. Not the track I had set off to put together but it might be the track I needed to put together right now. I do like this, and hope that others get something out of it too, but I guess I just had poured a lot more self reflective vibes here.

    <p>Well‚Ä¶ here it is for today
https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI
The track gave me some problems. Mostly Total Recall‚Ä¶ I just realized that it triggers or rather changes parameters on the down event of a clock or gate‚Ä¶ and Pam‚Äôs was sending a gate for 50% of a beat, meaning that the change was happening on 1.3 instead of 1.1 of a bar. Doh! This was giving me all kinds of problems, and I‚Äôll need to rethink how I‚Äôm using Total Recall. The quick fix was to change the gate width from 50% down to 1%, but I still feel like this leaves some margin for error. Back to the drawing board a bit for how I‚Äôm using Total recall. Surprisingly, I hadn‚Äôt even noticed this until today‚Ä¶ I guess the more ambient sounds just weren‚Äôt making me notice it so much, but the arp today‚Ä¶ woah boy‚Ä¶ was it messing with my timing‚Ä¶ took a few tries before I got to the ‚Äúis it me, or is it you‚Äù thought‚Ä¶ I guess at least it wasn‚Äôt me this time.

    <p>Yah‚Ä¶ sometimes we just need to simplify!
https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ
Could‚Äôve made this into a longer track, but yeah‚Ä¶ I think keeping it short and simple definitely kept it moving and interesting. At least I feel like I got more out of it than I would have otherwise trying to layer a ton of sounds in and then having a big mess.
Effectively I made the four tracks on the MPC to begin with, and spent the time making sure I was happy with the eight bars first, pretty similar to what I did yesterday. From there I just starting assigning tracks to different outputs on the MPC, and then driving them through different effects in eurorack, and then, as usual, I chased it with the SP 202 and SP 303 at the tail end to just add the dust, grit, and grunge for the song.

    <p>Decided to keep it simple today‚Ä¶ really simple.
https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8
What all is going on? The picture comes from Neural Blender again‚Ä¶ still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it‚Äôs definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.
Well‚Ä¶ the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its‚Äô range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly &#43;4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela‚Äôs New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.

This is my pretty traditional setup I‚Äôve been going for lately, but with the SP 202 and SP 303 added to the end of the chain‚Ä¶ oh and I‚Äôve added in the Zoom H6 at the end of chain to function a bit as a mixer/audio router‚Ä¶ the RCA to 1/4&#34; adaptors are what is causing me the biggest headache in this setup‚Ä¶ but it is kind of nice having the 202 do LPF duties at the end of the chain, and then the Vinyl FX from the 303 to do some compression and wow/flutter duties‚Ä¶ and a hint of vinyl noise.
