      <description>&lt;p&gt;My sister has released the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/SOMNIUM-Beyond-Darkness-D-Sterling-ebook/dp/B087T5TVSS#ace-g1639449406&#34;&gt;SOMNIUM Beyond the Darkness&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon as a kindle book and as a paperback book, which is an excellent read for young adults and adults alike. She&amp;rsquo;s been looking to expand out into the audio book space, which makes sense to me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had been looking into some voice actors who could read the book. When I heard the audio quality of the demo, it was rather poor. We were hoping that it was just a quick demo, but it suffered from a lot of background noise. My sister passed on links to the voice actor, and the demo&amp;rsquo;s she had on her website were great. After I gave my sister a few questions to ask and suggestions for contract negotiations, unfortunately it fell through. We suspect that the voice actor recorded her website demo at a professional studio, and likely recorded the demo she produced for my sister at home. Total bummer, but it&amp;rsquo;s better to both live and learn, and get through these miss steps early is what I always say.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
