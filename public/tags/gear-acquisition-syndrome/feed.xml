      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to link off to anything I am selling, as I am not looking to drive attention to it or try and raise awareness. Instead I figured I&amp;rsquo;d write up why I am going about selling gear off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year I have really been looking to tighten up my process for making music. I also have spent about twenty years collecting gear, and some of that gear has had a habit of collecting dust. It is no particular fault of the gear, but when we work on music we&amp;rsquo;re constantly making choices, and a lot of my choices are of the type &amp;ldquo;this versus that&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I know how to use this really well and that other device not so much&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
