      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the above MPC Forums topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=210039&#34;&gt;BUG ON MPC 2.9? PLUGIN TRACK LEVEL EFFECTS PROGRAM LEVEL&lt;/a&gt; I created a test project to see if I could reproduce the issue below. In essence, the poster was stating that when they change the velocity setting on the track level for a plugin, that it was impacting the velocity setting for another track with the same plugin. Unfortunately this is mostly what I have for information at the time, making it difficult to either confirm or deny the problem. Below is some notes on what I attempted to test to see if I could figure out what the poster was hitting because this wasn&amp;rsquo;t behavior that I had come across before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
