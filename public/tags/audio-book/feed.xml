      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I just (hopefully) wrapped up the audio processing for my sister&amp;rsquo;s book. Since the last post, I probably could have done three other posts about the series of events that happened. Suffice it to say that there are some competing formats, tools, and audiobook sites that aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly in alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; I had gotten my sister&amp;rsquo;s book all processed, converted to .mp3 format, and she was quite happy with the sound. Unfortunately she doesn&amp;rsquo;t really understand audio processing or audio file formats, so this kicked off a chain of unfortunate re-exports. Each process and export job probably took me 60-90 minutes&amp;hellip; and since I had only ever expected to do this twice, I never automated the job. Each time I ended up processing the files, it was &amp;ldquo;just one more change&amp;rdquo; which had me shrug, and go off and do a whole bunch of clicking to re-process the files again. After time five, you&amp;rsquo;d think I would have learned my lesson. Which I did, but maybe not the one you&amp;rsquo;d think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
