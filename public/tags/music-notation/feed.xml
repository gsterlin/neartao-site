      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well over at the MPC Forums a user created a topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=204251&#34;&gt;Tidy Keygroup Names&lt;/a&gt; and thought that there was a bug when they were auto sampling, as it was putting f/p/fm/pm into the names of the samples instead of actual velocity. I chuckled to myself, because this seems kind of strange to show up into sample names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this strange you may ask? Well, for starters the auto sampler uses both the note names, as well as the midi note numbers in the file name when you auto sample an instrument. This makes sense, even if it is duplicate information. However, when you do multiple velocity levels, the auto sampler adds f/fm/pm/p (or a subset there of) into the file names. Strange huh? Especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
