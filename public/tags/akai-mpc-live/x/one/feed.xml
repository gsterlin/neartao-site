      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yorgos just released the 2.0.2 mastering suite for the Akai MPC Live/X/One using some of the new features in the 2.10 firmware. If you already have the suite you should have gotten an email, and he also posted some information on the MPC Forums thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=189006&#34;&gt;YA MASTERING TEMPLATE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is what I just posted in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=189006&amp;amp;start=180&#34;&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;, but adding here for posterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a track with and without using the YA Mastering Template 2.0.2. Anything that sounds bad here is frankly on me for not taking a bit more time to adjust and get the sonics under control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Folks seem to have liked the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2021/01/18/so-you-just-bought-an-akai-mpc-500-what-next/&#34;&gt;You just bought an Akai MPC 500, whatÂ next?&lt;/a&gt; post, so it&amp;rsquo;s about time to put one together for the MPC Live/X/One family of MPCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;internal-storage&#34;&gt;Internal Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am moving this to the top, as a warning to MPC buyers. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t put you off from buying the device, but just to help keep your sanity if you are thinking of purchasing one or have just purchased one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Messing around with the bass side of things, and liked how this was sounding. I tried to sample the space that had the most interesting sound to it, and going into the high end it rather tails off around C3 to C4&amp;hellip; so don&amp;rsquo;t expect to use this as a lead by and stretch of the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-bass-bottoms-up.zip&#34;&gt;NT-Bass-Bottoms Up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-bass-bottoms-up.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a bit of time adjusting the ADSR, it was on the edge of popping on the attack, and I adjusted the release so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just abruptly stop. These changes were made in the program, so you can undo them if you want to keep the character.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NT-Modular-Be Spoke Accordian</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/05/13/nt-modular-be-spoke-accordian/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=2793</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was kind of hunting around for a bit of an accordion sound, and figured this was close enough to a synthetic sound as I was going to make with the modular case today. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to the NT-Modular-Wet Lazers key group I put together, just a few patch changes for how the filter operates and which wave table I was using out of the Disting EX Plus Alpha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-be-spoke-accordian.zip&#34;&gt;nt-modular-be-spoke-accordian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-be-spoke-accordian.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; queue up the kinda cheesy FX sounds&amp;hellip; this is mostly just the Disting EX routed through Squawk Dirty To Me for filtering. Honestly it&amp;rsquo;s not *that* special, but I did do a little bit of LFO routing into a VCA into the resonance CV control to get that slight vibration sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-wet-lazers.zip&#34;&gt;nt-modular-wet-lazers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-wet-lazers.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did try briefly to see if it was quick to use velocity CV out from the MPC, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get it working with just a few knob twiddles, so frankly&amp;hellip; I failed at it. Going to need a bit more reading of the manual again to see how to get it going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still taking a break from wrist issues, but I had some time to throw together a new drum kit. Baggin is a few different sounds I was messing with elsewhere, and probably don&amp;rsquo;t really go together, but I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to try and put a track together. Likely it&amp;rsquo;s going to take a bit of FX and filter to tame, but I figured I&amp;rsquo;d post up the samples for anybody who is interested. I&amp;rsquo;ve got the pads color coded, so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll help you around the patch a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NT-Modular-Last Breath</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/05/11/nt-modular-last-breath/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 14:11:00 +0000</pubDate>
       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=2781</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a super simple patch I put together on the modular, simple because this smaller case only has a handful of modules in it. While it isn&amp;rsquo;t complete yet, I wanted to test out and see how well it did or did not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-last-breath.zip&#34;&gt;NT-Modular-Last Breath&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/nt-modular-last-breath.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound is basically an oscillator running on the Disting EX in dual mode, so that I could also get an envelope generator, because I don&amp;rsquo;t have that in this case at the moment. The oscillator is fed into the VCA, which is modulated by an LFO running positive on the Left channel, and running negative on the Right channel, this creates a kind of panning tremolo effect. I think routed that audio output into another pair of VCAs so that I could control the volume by the envelope. From there, the audio is running into a stereo filter to augment the sound a bit and give it some resonance to adjust the sound a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Setup Your Akai MPC Live/X using Bluetooth Midi with your iPad running Synth One</title>

&lt;p&gt;Well folks, I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to try and help you out for questions in the comments. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this Synth One specific video helps. I suspect that the issue with the MPC not seeing audio is due to the user not hooking up the audio outputs from their iPad/iPhone to the MPC, but just a guess. Hopefully this will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Midi only carries note data such as what note number and velocity, it does not carry audio information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to sync your OP-1 to your MPC Live/X/One</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is just a quick video to walk you through how to sync a Teenage Engineering OP-1 to an Akai MPC Live/X/One over USB. The steps are pretty straightforward, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to add the steps below as well for those that would prefer to skip the video and just want some text to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akai MPC Live/X/One Setup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On you&amp;rsquo;re MPC, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to head over to the menu by pressing the MENU button. This will get you into your normal menu. You can choose to have the top middle setting SYNC to Off or something else, but personally I&amp;rsquo;d just turn it off since in this case we just want the MPC to control the master sync.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just testing a few things on the VX90/S950 combo setup and figured I would record off a few key groups to see how things were sounding. Below are the files if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in checking them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that Cherry Crush was the first key group that I recorded yesterday after getting everything setup and working again. I recorded a sample into the S950 and then worked on tweaking the filter and resonance to see what kind of sweet spots I could find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disable Q-Link Overlay on Akai MPC Live/One</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/02/19/disable-q-link-overlay-on-akai-mpc-live-one/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=2281</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Folks seem to be unhappy with the Q-Link overlay that was added into the Akai MPC Live/Live II/One firmware. While it is handy, it can put this overlay over the end of a sample you are trying to edit as soon as you touch the Q-Link, and can be about as annoying as it is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn it off, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to get into the Preferences Menu, go into General, and scroll down to the bottom and look for &amp;ldquo;SHOW QLINK STATUS WHEN TOUCHED&amp;rdquo;, and remove the check mark. This will enable/disable this feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick video to build on my last post &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2021/02/03/akai-mpc-live-x-one-bluetooth-midi-with-an-ipad/&#34;&gt;Akai MPC Live/X/One Bluetooth MIDI With an iPad&lt;/a&gt; where I had describe how to get a Bluetooth MIDI connection working. In this post I will cover how to quickly get audio out of your iPad into your MPC, and get the MIDI connection over bluetooth to control/sequence the synthesizer on your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recorded another video to go along with the post. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to follow step by step instructions I&amp;rsquo;ll also write them up after the video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai MPC Live/X/One Plugin Track Velocity Test</title>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.wordpress.com/?p=1880</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the above MPC Forums topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&amp;amp;t=210039&#34;&gt;BUG ON MPC 2.9? PLUGIN TRACK LEVEL EFFECTS PROGRAM LEVEL&lt;/a&gt; I created a test project to see if I could reproduce the issue below. In essence, the poster was stating that when they change the velocity setting on the track level for a plugin, that it was impacting the velocity setting for another track with the same plugin. Unfortunately this is mostly what I have for information at the time, making it difficult to either confirm or deny the problem. Below is some notes on what I attempted to test to see if I could figure out what the poster was hitting because this wasn&amp;rsquo;t behavior that I had come across before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
