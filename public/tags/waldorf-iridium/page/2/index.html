https://soundcloud.com/neartao/method-of-attack
The picture comes from a trip to Disney World that my wife and I took our daughter to for her third birthday. She doesn‚Äôt remember the trip at all today, but at the time she had a blast. When she was younger she was quite a clingy kid, and I can still remember how sore my shoulders were because she refused to walk anywhere and instead wanted to ride on my shoulders for the entire trip. Do not recommend‚Ä¶ the shoulder part‚Ä¶ the Disney trip was great :D

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mad-cap
The image comes courtesy of one of my wife‚Äôs trips to New York City with her friends years ago. I repurposed it for my track‚Ä¶ hopefully she doesn‚Äôt mind :D
I mentioned yesterday that I started working on this track yesterday right after throwing in the towel for day two, and I really dig how this track came out. I decided to keep the flow super short, so it is just a Main section, Drop section, and Outro section‚Ä¶ so absolutely nothing fancy, but I don‚Äôt feel like it needed much else.

    <p>Day two of #jamuary 2021
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/biggest-regret
The picture comes courtesy of my daughter finding a frog in the backyard over the summer and we caught a few pictures of it. She was super excited to have found such a small critter hanging out in the back yard and just wanted to get a few close ups of the little guy (or gal).
I fiddled with this track a bit throughout the day and it never quite came together the way I wanted. I tried to play everything out by hand as much as possible, and well‚Ä¶ I find it okay. The transitions between sections are particularly week again, and I know I could have done better to build up more energy if I had just had the time. Instead I decided to cut my losses on this track and move forward to preparing for day three instead‚Ä¶ which meant this track suffered.

    <p>Well it looks like I am back for another month of jamming out!
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/requiem-for-a-soul
First off, the picture is of my oldest dog, Amy (pronounced Emmy). I was trying to find a picture that might feel a little dreamy, where you might not quite know what was going on, was maybe a little shocking, but not really in the terrifying space. This was a picture from taking Amy home from being spayed, and we had to put the cone on her head to keep her from licking the wound. She is by no means intimidating, and is actually one of the sweetest dogs you could find, but this picture does make her look a little haunted.

So this track has several key groups that I auto sampled off of both my Access Virus TI2 Darkstar and Waldorf Iridium. I figured I‚Äôd upload the patches for those interested or who are just looking for some synth sounds to play with‚Ä¶ so you can get them below. I didn‚Äôt bother trimming anything‚Ä¶ so the file is a bit large‚Ä¶ but go nuts and have fun!

Picture comes courtesy of a sunset in Aruba from a couple years back. Took the family to go see the island, and we all had a blast. Heck even got my wife into the ocean for a little bit, despite her being completely afraid to hop into water!
To get the notes I played around with Orb Composer a bit in order to come up with note progressions for Arp/Bass/Chord/Melody‚Ä¶ The key is Ab, Major scale with a chord progression of i-iv-vii-II, or Abmb7/Eb, Dbm/Ab, Gbmb7, and Bbb/Fb. I tried to use the MPC Live Performance Pads to operate in the correct scale‚Ä¶ maybe it worked? I didn‚Äôt play out too much live so it isn‚Äôt exactly like it probably mattered much.

This has been a lot of back to back to back tracks for me, and I am kind of looking forward to the month ending so I can get into a different musical head space. This was just a straight up Expansion Pack kit that I loaded up, and then added a bit more to it with some samples from my brand spanking new Waldorf Iridium. I was more into just playing with the Iridium than making a track, but figured I needed to get moving and actually put something together.
