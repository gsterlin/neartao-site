The intent for this track was to put some content together in Reason and then make some create patterns that changed chord structures throughout the song.

    <p>Day twenty‚Ä¶ I can feel that the end of jamcember is nearing :D
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/tea-in-the-dark
Today I went back to the now ‚Äúold‚Äù standard of making some loops in Reason Studio, working on some sound design to get some interesting sounds, and then bouncing the loops out to be chopped.
A few things I tried to switch it up. First, I made four bar loops, but extended them out to eight bars, because I wanted the ambience to flow through to the start of the first bar, instead of hearing the loop in the first bar kind of catch up. Something sounds a bit off‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs possible that I have an LFO that is not sync‚Äôd to the track, or maybe my copy/paste of notes was bad. I tried it‚Ä¶ and while it didn‚Äôt work quite how I wanted, well‚Ä¶ it still produced results.

I just like this track‚Ä¶ guess I have nothing else to say about it today :D
Update:
Okay‚Ä¶ I was being lazy yesterday‚Ä¶ cleaning up after the blizzard kind of got to me.
For this track I really decided to pair down the frantic energy and focus a bit more on natural sounding instruments with some air, space, and environment to them. As I said yesterday, I am quite happy about how it came out, though mixing was a bit of a pain due to how different the levels were on all of the tracks.

As for the track, probably approaching the last days during this month of pulling content off of Reason Studio daily and then chopping up loops for inspiration, so I‚Äôll be looking around for another sound source or two for the month just to push myself in other directions. I‚Äôve been itching to do some sound recording, and who knows, maybe I go industrial?

I am still having a blast making loops in Reason and exporting it out to the MPC for chopping up. This track had a lot going on with it, and I had fun making the initial four bars‚Ä¶ but once I got started tracking it out into a song things really went sideways. The transitions just didn‚Äôt work and the track started to fall apart. I think it was more a case of a few different sounds just not supporting each other very well and while I was having fun making the four bar loop it wasn‚Äôt obvious, but when trying to put transitions together it became a bit jarring.

This track needed some mixing love, I tried to nail it, but I still think the saw synth is a bit intense. Perhaps this is what the track needed? I‚Äôm not sure. After this many tracks can I really be sure of anything?
Well, I am sure that all of the content was yet again produced in Reason Studio, and I ran it through the Yorgos Arabatzsis Mastering. I‚Äôm getting a bit more of a handle with both making loops in Reason Studio 11, and working with YAM to get the sounds I am looking for, and pushing the sounds I don‚Äôt like back.

This is another track that I spent some time putting together four bar loops in Reason Studio 11 in order to get some content that I could chop up and mangle in the MPC.
There wasn‚Äôt anything too special about the chops, but the bass line was played out a bit wonky to start, and I just kind of went with it. The first two bars are super simple, and then the last two bars get a lot more complex. From there, I built a lot of the melody and chords around it.

This track was a ton of fun to put together. I wanted to change my perspective on making tracks this month, and decided to focus on chopping up samples, but 100% making my own content. So this project started as a deep dive into Reason Studio 11 to really really really get into some sound design. I knew I wanted to go glitchy and spacey, and I think I pretty well delivered on those themes in this track. So all drum patterns, loops, everything were initially created in a 30 minute session in Reason, and then I bounced and exported six tracks.
