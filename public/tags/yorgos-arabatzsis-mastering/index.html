    <p>Based on feedback, tried to make this track much louder, and maybe got a little too carried away. Now I think it has pushed into a bit too crunchy and toasty territory. I probably should not have been driving the STMix so hard :/.
The bass line is only 2 bars long and absolutely needs some variations to move it around, or something to tie off every 4 or 8 bars‚Ä¶ just something different. Ah well, this was fun and definitely deserves a second try at thinking about how to drive all the content through the eurorack anyways, and might be something to expand on some more to build out into a set.

    <p>Mostly happy with how this track came out‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/always
Picture is just of the SP-202‚Ä¶ just thought it looked kinda cool all lit up.
The track itself came together pretty quickly, though I did have to go tweak a number of samples once I ran it through YAM‚Ä¶ all of a sudden I was noticing all kinds of clipping and noise. The atmospheric sound at the beginning was full of so many pops and clips. I didn‚Äôt remove all of them, but definitely reduced it a bit by just tweaking the program. The bass was just super noisy, probably as a result from having run it through the SP-202 a bit, so I had to drop a LPF on it to clean it up.

    <p>Something that I was working on last month, and dug up to make sure it got completed‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flexing
The picture is from the zoo we visited in Hawaii.
The track itself I worked on while visiting my sister and came about from trying to prep some content for jamming with my brother in law. We got a couple good jam sessions in, but nothing recorded. This particular track was something that I was just up in the morning messing with and had saved off for a while and figured it was something worth saving to work on and finishing later. Up at 6am this morning, got a long day ahead, and figured it was as good a time as any to run it across the finish line!

The picture is another one from the walk. Just some train tracks that I had to walk over, and look like a good time to snap a quick picture.
More importantly though, what I had for lunch. Chicken Tikka Masala, and boy did it hit the spot! Sure it was store bought, packaged, and needed to be reheated, but it is what I had available at the time, or I could have had some fajita leftovers, but I think I am saving those for tonight.

Below is what I just posted in the thread, but adding here for posterity.

  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This track started while I was out visiting my sister and her family last week. Was just sitting on a chair and knocking out some sounds to see what would stick.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/hungers
The picture is from a library, the venting looked interesting so a snapped a picture. Ran it through a Ps Camera filter (elements?) just to see how it would look.
This track is a mix of loops I grabbed, and loading up some synths and using pad performer to try and get some other sounds in tune with the loops I was grabbing. Not rocket science, but the way that the loops were reported as a key in the MPC Sample Edit section made it a bit awkward to figure a few things out. Mostly because the MPC refuses to acknowledge flats, so it always thinks everything is sharp. Not a big deal per se, but it can mean that you‚Äôve got to think through what key/note range it thinks content is in and then break it down into what you are actually going to play. Sure if you do it right it all matches up regardless if you are sharp or flat, but it can mean that the way you think about some of the notes is just off, if that makes sense?

The track came together pretty quickly while I was watching my daughter play the sims, make a character of me‚Ä¶ who she promptly made broke, and then I guess I was then homeless. She had my avatar doing a lot of weird things. It makes me wonder what my daughter thinks of me sometimes.
