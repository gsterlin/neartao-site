The picture comes from a trip to Disney World that my wife and I took our daughter to for her third birthday. She doesn‚Äôt remember the trip at all today, but at the time she had a blast. When she was younger she was quite a clingy kid, and I can still remember how sore my shoulders were because she refused to walk anywhere and instead wanted to ride on my shoulders for the entire trip. Do not recommend‚Ä¶ the shoulder part‚Ä¶ the Disney trip was great :D

The image comes courtesy of one of my wife‚Äôs trips to New York City with her friends years ago. I repurposed it for my track‚Ä¶ hopefully she doesn‚Äôt mind :D
I mentioned yesterday that I started working on this track yesterday right after throwing in the towel for day two, and I really dig how this track came out. I decided to keep the flow super short, so it is just a Main section, Drop section, and Outro section‚Ä¶ so absolutely nothing fancy, but I don‚Äôt feel like it needed much else.

The picture comes courtesy of my daughter finding a frog in the backyard over the summer and we caught a few pictures of it. She was super excited to have found such a small critter hanging out in the back yard and just wanted to get a few close ups of the little guy (or gal).
I fiddled with this track a bit throughout the day and it never quite came together the way I wanted. I tried to play everything out by hand as much as possible, and well‚Ä¶ I find it okay. The transitions between sections are particularly week again, and I know I could have done better to build up more energy if I had just had the time. Instead I decided to cut my losses on this track and move forward to preparing for day three instead‚Ä¶ which meant this track suffered.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ninth-circle
This track came about from creating an audio track from a 32 bar loop on the Access Virus TI2 Darkstar. I automated a few parameters and figured it sound cool enough to add some drums and FX to it. I wanted to try and get something slower and more droning this time around, instead of some of the faster and more manic tracks I have been laying down the last month.

Picture comes courtesy of a sunset in Aruba from a couple years back. Took the family to go see the island, and we all had a blast. Heck even got my wife into the ocean for a little bit, despite her being completely afraid to hop into water!
To get the notes I played around with Orb Composer a bit in order to come up with note progressions for Arp/Bass/Chord/Melody‚Ä¶ The key is Ab, Major scale with a chord progression of i-iv-vii-II, or Abmb7/Eb, Dbm/Ab, Gbmb7, and Bbb/Fb. I tried to use the MPC Live Performance Pads to operate in the correct scale‚Ä¶ maybe it worked? I didn‚Äôt play out too much live so it isn‚Äôt exactly like it probably mattered much.

The intent for this track was to put some content together in Reason and then make some create patterns that changed chord structures throughout the song.

I felt like I was just pulling things together randomly‚Ä¶ and then when I‚Äôd start to track out different sections nothing felt like it felt like it worked together. Heck, I removed half of this track because it just didn‚Äôt sit in place correctly and the transitions were quite jarring. It is possible that I am just getting tired of making a track a day, but I think it‚Äôs just the mood.

    <p>There weren‚Äôt any other entries, so I figured what the heck and put together a track.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action
The sample itself was pretty basic, so I figured I would work on chopping it up and just finding a drum kit to play to it. I wanted to focus as much as possible on keeping the original audio track playing throughout the track without it sounding too repetitive, this meant making variations to work through, and seeing what worked. Ultimately I wanted some of the shorter chops to play longer through this process, so a quick detune of 6 semitones had me pretty well sorted so that I didn‚Äôt have any gaps of silence.

This is another track that I tried to go for a more minimal sound, and it was made up of only three loops. I know the track itself is not very complex or technical, but I worked on making up for it by making a few variations of each loop to get some variety in the flips. Given that I am still doing a new track a day, and time has been at a premium, this gave me a bit more time to be picky on the loops that I chose to work with in order to put the track together.
