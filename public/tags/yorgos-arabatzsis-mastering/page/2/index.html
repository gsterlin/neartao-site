    <p>Day 23‚Ä¶ just a handful more to put together to wrap up the month!
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/foundation
The picture is from a trip to Puerto Rico‚Ä¶ probably around twenty years ago now. Just a quick snap that I took while driving by the beach. The water down there is amazing!
Putting the track together, I figured I‚Äôd work on something a bit more experimental, so not quite so traditional drums and sounds, and just see how it came together. Overall, I am relatively happy with it, but the mixing seems off. I spent some time trying to adjust the levels, but I think there‚Äôs some EQ and filtering that would need to be done to really make the track pop. I did my best by ear, but I got stuck in a few areas where having some visuals to go with the EQ to see where harmonics are probably would have helped be a bit more precise, instead of just using a low pass and high pass filter to just remove sounds completely.

The pictures is of a family friend‚Äôs dog, that just looked super evil for the day. I might have to play with the picture again, because it could really turn into something special. Not today though‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs just about time to start preparing for tomorrow!
This track is just a straight up noisy DnB track‚Ä¶ I initially wasn‚Äôt intending to get so gritty but everything just kind of fell into place that way. I had a ton more FX I had layered in, but had a bit of a hard time figuring out if you can automate turning FX on and off (turns out as far as I can tell you cannot).

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/you-alright
The painting is from when I used to record art lessons and post them online‚Ä¶ I think I did about 100 episodes, under the title ‚ÄúPainting in Five‚Äù. This particular one was showing how to paint out a rough sketch, and I‚Äôm quite certain it was based off of the lion from the MCM Grand. At any rate, the idea was to just show people how to quickly get some things down without thinking too much about whether it was good or bad. And now‚Ä¶ about twenty years later, I am doing a track a day just to get myself to put something down. Maybe I should bring back the ‚ÄúIn Five‚Äù concept in the blog? I‚Äôve been thinking about it, but haven‚Äôt committed to anything yet.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/high-and-tight
The picture is from a game of air hockey with my daughter from years ago. Something we used to do a lot at the local kid casino‚Ä¶ but she is too old for that now :D.
The track was made using drums from MPC Tutor‚Äôs latest drum kit‚Ä¶ The Underground Crates. If you‚Äôre looking for some new drums definitely check it out. I‚Äôm digging this MPC Expansion so far, and can see it having a lot of mileage. The rest of the track is just a chopped up bass and chopped up guitar sample. Nothing too exciting‚Ä¶ and I had a vocal track with it, but it was just too much. I ended up just going for keeping this track simple and chilled out today‚Ä¶ so it isn‚Äôt exactly special‚Ä¶ but I really liked how chilled out and fun it sounded.

    <p>Day 17‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/fears-for-tears
The picture is from a painting I did years ago‚Ä¶ I think I gave it to my mom? *shrug*‚Ä¶ somebody probably still has it.
This track came together pretty fast. I started with a pretty basic drum beat and bass line, and tweaked the FX, pitch, etc‚Ä¶ a bit to get a bit more of an interesting sound. It wasn‚Äôt long before I added in the piano. This is just a chopped up loop, and I decided to do something different, and work on make a 32 bar playing of the chops, instead of doing my usual 4 or 8 bar play through and then working with the loops. I‚Äôm going to have to consider this in the future, as it was both fun to see different ways I could utilize the sample, but I also got a few interesting places I normally wouldn‚Äôt get to.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/almost-there
The picture is a chocolate cake we had for Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶ really good‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure my wife picked it up at Whole Foods‚Ä¶ if I remember correctly.
For the track it‚Äôs another mix of chops and synths‚Ä¶ and auto sampling‚Ä¶ and mistakes. I spent a lot of time looking for sounds that I felt would work together, so this track feels pretty good. Normally I‚Äôd upload the auto sampled synth‚Ä¶ but it has echo in it‚Ä¶ making me have to record every single note for the group, and then this makes it hard to use outside of a 96bpm standpoint‚Ä¶ as well‚Ä¶ it also only works for the notes I sampled which‚Ä¶ put it in the rather not so useful category for a general standpoint. I may try and find a good delay/reverb match to make it into a generic MPC patch‚Ä¶ but for now it just felt kind of strange to upload something so rigid and honestly kind of single purpose.
