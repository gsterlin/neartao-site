The picture comes courtesy of my back yard. Well I sold my house, so technically now it is the new owner‚Äôs back yard, but I am currently still living here. Setup a lease back arrangement while I am waiting on the new place. About a month to a month and a half to go‚Ä¶ and believe me, I am ready‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about time to get my damn music studio back together so I can get access to sounds that I want when I want them. That said, it‚Äôs been quite nice to be working with a greatly reduced set of sound sources‚Ä¶ so it hasn‚Äôt been an issue by any stretch of the imagination.

    <p>Day 16‚Ä¶ it may be cold outside but it is getting warm in here‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/almost-there
The picture is a chocolate cake we had for Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶ really good‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure my wife picked it up at Whole Foods‚Ä¶ if I remember correctly.
For the track it‚Äôs another mix of chops and synths‚Ä¶ and auto sampling‚Ä¶ and mistakes. I spent a lot of time looking for sounds that I felt would work together, so this track feels pretty good. Normally I‚Äôd upload the auto sampled synth‚Ä¶ but it has echo in it‚Ä¶ making me have to record every single note for the group, and then this makes it hard to use outside of a 96bpm standpoint‚Ä¶ as well‚Ä¶ it also only works for the notes I sampled which‚Ä¶ put it in the rather not so useful category for a general standpoint. I may try and find a good delay/reverb match to make it into a generic MPC patch‚Ä¶ but for now it just felt kind of strange to upload something so rigid and honestly kind of single purpose.

The picture‚Ä¶ I believe is from Disney, from the animal park resort. I am pretty sure I mentioned how much my daughter loved that trip. We had a blast, and it was great to see all of the different animals.
This track is a mix of chops, and synths. I started by chopping up a break, and then moved on to finding some guitar sounds to fill out some of what I thought was going to be a lead and the bass‚Ä¶ but well‚Ä¶ the bass sound was decidedly not inspiring‚Ä¶ and I kind of drowned up the guitar sound in a lot of this track with some of the synths (whoops). So not the end of the world, and something that could be patched up with some mixing, but my intent here was to work on keeping things in key, or as in key as I could without totally knowing what I was doing.

The image is from a trip years ago that we took our daughter to the Boston Commons and is of the paddle boat that you can take a little tour around the duck pond. Our daughter was never super excited to get on the boat, and I‚Äôm not sure we ever did at that age, now she‚Äôs probably too old to think it would be something fun to do. Honestly, having done the ride before myself, it‚Äôs a little pricey, and you don‚Äôt really get too much excitement out of it.

Boy, the picture is from about four years ago‚Ä¶ Amy is looking impressively squinty‚Ä¶ might have been from the flash, I don‚Äôt really recall. Looked like a goofy enough picture to work with for today‚Äôs track though. She‚Äôs watching you!
Today I took my own personal advice from yesterday and only applied transposes to the track level, and not the sequence level of the song. I figured that way I‚Äôm not having drums hop all over the place and can have some more control over what is going on. It was a little bit more work, but it wasn‚Äôt insurmountable.

    <p>The track was named as such‚Ä¶ because I threw my hands up in desperation. *not* a good track, but I did learn something‚Ä¶ but first
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-time-here-is-done
So the picture comes courtesy of the dang thing that the MPC Live did to twist up my song.
Yeah, above is the drum track‚Ä¶ but let me explain how I got there‚Ä¶
I figured I would play around with transpose on sequence mode‚Ä¶ just do a pattern of I/IV/I/V‚Ä¶ (or no semitone offset, &#43;4 semitone offset, no semitone offset, &#43;5 semitone offset). With me so far? I basically just copied my main sequence twice, second sequence I put a &#43;4 semitone transpose on the sequence, and for the third sequence I put a &#43;5 semitone transpose on the sequence. I then went to song mode and just did the pattern Seq 1, Seq 2, Seq 3, Seq 4‚Ä¶ and then converted the whole thing back into a sequence.

Putting this track together was fun‚Ä¶ but I did struggle a bit (again) with audio tracks, external midi, and exporting the file. I know I grumbled about this before, but Akai really needs to get an ability to mix in from the inputs for a track if/when you need to. I suppose posting everything to audio tracks is fine, but the workflow is just wonky to me. I‚Äôll quit my belly aching on it, but it did lead to a bit of a mess uploading a track that was missing a core synth part. On the pro soundcloud account it‚Äôs not a *huge* problem to replace a track, but boy was it funny to go back and listen to the track and notice it was missing. It‚Äôs something I can fix in my on process for creating and publishing songs, but‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a hassle. Also‚Ä¶ to be fair, even if there was a checkbox to use external gear to get it in from the inputs I‚Äôd probably still complain about it being a problem because then I‚Äôd probably double up sounds, or cause myself other problems. Maybe it is fine Akai? Maybe! This is just something that‚Äôs been such an ingrained workflow in DAWs though, that it does lead me to at least one area where the MPC in standalone isn‚Äôt quite enough as a DAW. Everything inside the box it is cool, but exporting out content it doesn‚Äôt work quite so hot. /grumbling off‚Ä¶
