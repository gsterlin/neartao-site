      <description>&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Erik and sent him this picture so he knew I had the case in hand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3b1989f0-f4b8-439f-9186-2a59c4b9548f%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to strong arm the case up to my desk, and upon turning it on I can tell you the noise from the power was very very high! I was concerned that it was a dirty power supply, but figured that once I had racked everything the sound might go down&amp;hellip; sometimes power supplies make a lot of noise when they don&amp;rsquo;t have a load on them, or too much of a load. You never know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I got the notice from UPS that the case was on it&amp;rsquo;s way, and it will be here today! Super excited to get my hands on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a few pictures of the package and opening up the packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/3b1989f0-f4b8-439f-9186-2a59c4b9548f%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UPS delivery person said this was one of the best packaged shipments he has ever seen, and I have to agree. We flipped it (shhhh&amp;hellip; don&amp;rsquo;t tell Erik Needham). This is a beefy case, and I have to say, it looks like some pretty good quality wood for the case.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
