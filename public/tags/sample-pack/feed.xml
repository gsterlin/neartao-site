      <title>[Sample Pack] Time Out</title>

&lt;p&gt;I put this Drum Kit together with the intent of making it quite noisy in mind.  It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more of a harsh industrial kind of sound, so you&amp;rsquo;re likely going to want to apply effects to tame these sounds a bit.  A lot of what makes it rough was running the sounds through sample frequency reduction and a pretty heavy level of compression.  This gives the tails of the sounds an especially unnatural nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Sample Pack] Harmful</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A drum kit I put together using a few scripts I threw together to try and help package all of this content up a bit neater so I can focus more on the samples and post content.  Right now I know I&amp;rsquo;m not writing anything terribly interesting, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the demo tracks I&amp;rsquo;m putting together show off the sample packs a bit.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be considering documenting up the process to get the samples together, but then again, maybe it isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly interesting.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just testing a few things on the VX90/S950 combo setup and figured I would record off a few key groups to see how things were sounding. Below are the files if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in checking them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that Cherry Crush was the first key group that I recorded yesterday after getting everything setup and working again. I recorded a sample into the S950 and then worked on tweaking the filter and resonance to see what kind of sweet spots I could find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A pad I put together as my first pass at making an BY-SA key group.  Definitely going to need to make some tools to simplify the process, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see how it works out after doing the next three sample packs for the month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This Sample Pack is intended as a drum kit that I put together as my first pass at making a BY-SA licensed Sample Pack.  Definitely going to need to make some tools to simplify the process, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see how it works out after doing the next three sample packs for the month before I get too ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
