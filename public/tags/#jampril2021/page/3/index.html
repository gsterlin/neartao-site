The picture comes from a trip to Greece I took two years ago with my family.
Was trying to put something a bit more LoFi sounding together, and I kind of feel like I failed. The mix is just off, and it doesn‚Äôt really feel dirty enough. Overall, I find the bass too loud and it probably needs some major taming. What was I thinking? Uhm‚Ä¶ not sure lol!

For this track I was trying to think about transitions between sections a bit more, and trying to see how it would come together. I kind of think the higher end synth sound is a bit distracting, and the track would probably be better without it. Maybe a few too many elements?
I am happy with the track feeling a bit more funky though, and trying to add in a few more somewhat random sounds moving in and out feels like a good effect.

Who said you can only do one track a day max? I had about 30 minutes free and ripped this one. I dig how it came out compared to the other track. I think most of what I like about it is that it‚Äôs simpler, and while it is pretty in your face, it doesn‚Äôt have quite so much going on.

    <p>Day 6, and put this together.
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/lets-grab-lunch
This is another Boss SP 303 sampled song, I spent a *lot* of time sampling into the SP 303, and then resampled back into the MPC. There are some things that I like here, but boy was it a lot of work, and honestly, I‚Äôm not sure the result was entirely worth it.
I like some of the sounds and how they came out, but I feel like this is not really that great. The Vox probably could use more work to make it different or change over time, and this is where I feel like I‚Äôm hitting a bit of a wall with producing exclusively on the MPC right now. Just a bit too much work to pull the audio apart and do something different with it.

This track was still hitting it into the Boss SP 303 and just recording off more samples for the FX. Definitely getting faster at sampling into the 303 and then resampling back.
Tried track mutes with timing corrects which worked out alright‚Ä¶ then doubled up the track and layered in a new track with some additional sounds/enhancements to spice things up. The mix is a bit off, but happy enough with how the track came out.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/breathing-in
Another track of sampling into the SP 303, and running effects and stuff, and then sampling back into the MPC to make a finished drum kit.
I played everything out with the Track Mute again‚Ä¶ but this time used TC. It helped a bit‚Ä¶ at least making it more obvious where problems were. Would try again hah.

    <p>Day 3‚Ä¶ This track I mostly wanted to mess around with the Boss SP 303 to understand the sampling workflow a bit better.

The picture is Isaac from the game ‚ÄúThe Binding of Isaac‚Äù. Cool kid.
To put this together I drove samples into the SP 303 C and D banks. They are much faster to sample on, even though it is still quite slow compared to modern standards. It was a pretty good way to test out the repair job that I did for the pads as well, since I was bouncing around a lot of the buttons, minus the pattern stuff. I‚Äôm not sure how much I care to bother with pattern sequencing here when I can just resample everything into the MPC. So I filled up all 16 smart media sample slots between bank C and D‚Ä¶ The samples came in between a mix of raw, and sometimes with some effects already running, and I did end up adding effects on the way out back into the MPC as well to make a drum kit.

The picture is just some flowers that my wife bought‚Ä¶ Calla Lilies if you‚Äôre interested. We‚Äôre trying to get more flowers in the house and make it feel more like home.
As for the track, this is straight up another MPC Live track. I grabbed a handful of samples and just got to chopping. I know I could have done a better job getting some of the slices together, but I tried to do it by ear as much as possible, and hey, I continue to approve of the slightly wonky and janky sound. So it was a lot of using the threshold chop mode to get the party started, and then adjusting the start/end points a bit by ear. I know for sure that a few of the mistakes in the chops came from forgetting to turn off the linked slices afterwards, but I haven‚Äôt really been doing much for tracks over the last TWO months, which has gotten me quite a bit out of practice. Only done a few hit or miss beat battles in between, and I hadn‚Äôt even bothered to write up a post about them. Well, I do need to get myself more focussed again
