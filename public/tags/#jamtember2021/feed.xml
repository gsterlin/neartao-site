      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use some of the patching done yesterday for the ambient tracks to make some DnB&amp;hellip; woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice Session first&amp;hellip; there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of mistakes, offbeat content, and a few places that some of the sounds got a bit too wild&amp;hellip; oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/pg0K1Gk5toI&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/pg0K1Gk5toI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I did a few more takes and settled on the following take as the &amp;lsquo;final&amp;rsquo; for this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/mgsyQkY1LUk&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/mgsyQkY1LUk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want a higher quality version of the audio for this final (probably) take you can get it at SoundCloud from below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just messing around way more today than I have all month&amp;hellip; but this is for better or worse lol :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Jam Session&amp;hellip; just loaded up a kit and figured I&amp;rsquo;d mess around for 10-15 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/gOaEgEJVQDg&#34;&gt;https://youtu.be/gOaEgEJVQDg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end I had no idea what I had in the Morphagene buffers, and just kind of went with it. Not really choices I should have made, but whatever&amp;hellip; just messing around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;hellip; the MPC Live mk2 rarely crashes on me&amp;hellip; and lost some work&amp;hellip; I suspect I know what I did&amp;hellip; but *sigh*&amp;hellip; anyways&amp;hellip; regrouped and did this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is just one of my watercolor paint sets&amp;hellip; almost went with a rain motif instead&amp;hellip; boy is it raining out right now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hah&amp;hellip; this shook out after three or four failed attempts to get something jamming right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture is from the trip to Yellowstone&amp;hellip; I mean&amp;hellip; if you ever can&amp;hellip; you got to go. Just amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah yeah yeah&amp;hellip; another vaporwave style&amp;hellip; and I swear, I&amp;rsquo;ll get some videos up of the process I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;hellip; honestly nothing too fancy, but I should probably see if I can get something similar to work just within the MPC instead of needing two&amp;hellip; retro/older&amp;hellip; Boss SPs&amp;hellip; yet&amp;hellip; it is frequently working&amp;hellip; so what do I know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay&amp;hellip; needed to try something different&amp;hellip; and this is both short and way out there&amp;hellip; but kind of dig it more than the last track for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>#jamtember2021 Track - Don&#39;t Forget Grandma</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; you literally have to smile when you hear the song and see the pic together&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s like illegal or something if you don&amp;rsquo;t. Now&amp;hellip; you don&amp;rsquo;t have to like either individually, but as a total package&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/dont-forget-grandma&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/dont-forget-grandma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my grandmother, or as many people knew her, as the world&amp;rsquo;s grandma. She was a great woman who cared for everybody. Honestly, she was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; just standard song duty for the day, kinda hit or miss again for me&amp;hellip; probably time to push myself in another direction, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to see what happens if I just do the same style/process for a month. What I think is happening is that I&amp;rsquo;m getting faster at the process, but also getting pickier&amp;hellip; who&amp;rsquo;d have thought?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#jamtember2021 Track - Everything Hurts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; this kind of went into the DnB direction&amp;hellip; and I just gave it a shot&amp;hellip; takes 30 seconds to come together, which isn&amp;rsquo;t really great&amp;hellip; but maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/everything-hurts&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/everything-hurts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the picture. Well this is my friend bee. Found the poor guy hanging out on my deck post, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t flying away. So I gave him some honey, which he ate up for a while. Later the honey and the bee were gone. Either I saved the bee&amp;rsquo;s life in its&amp;rsquo; time of need, or I ended up attracting something bigger that ate the bee. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. But as my friend, I am going to imagine that I saved the bee, and in the future he&amp;rsquo;s going to communicate to his bee buddies that I helped save his life and that he&amp;rsquo;ll return the favor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well not really what I meant to do&amp;hellip; had a sample prepared on the 202&amp;hellip; and then in a rush I deleted it&amp;hellip; yo&amp;hellip; not my finest. Next time I need to leave a sticky note or something for something *face palm*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flying-low&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flying-low&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways&amp;hellip; this was&amp;hellip; I dunno&amp;hellip; just another thing tossed together. Haven&amp;rsquo;t been feeling some of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting together, but still committing to doing something, anything&amp;hellip; at least once a day. And folks are posting for beatober&amp;hellip; do I go for it? Maybe&amp;hellip; but gonna have to do something different, cuz I&amp;rsquo;m definitely finding it hard to squeeze the time in the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Just knocked this out in maybe 30 minutes&amp;hellip; the mix is a bit off, definitely some of the parts could use some filtering or eq&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; gotta keep rolling these things out!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This picture is from a trip years ago&amp;hellip; bumper boats and all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a quick thing I knocked out as a second track for the day&amp;hellip; definitely had fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So I just used the picture from a website&amp;hellip; sue me&amp;hellip; well don&amp;rsquo;t&amp;hellip; but I didn&amp;rsquo;t happen to have eight lambic around to photograph&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another track in the vaporwave style&amp;hellip; or rather&amp;hellip; dumping some loops/sounds into the SP-202 and making something pitched down&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m probably abusing this too much by now for making a track a day for the month&amp;hellip; but hey&amp;hellip; if it works? Keep on filtering? Keep on trying out the new synths on the MPC from 2.10? I mean heck yeah!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3174</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shot off a second track for the day&amp;hellip; this time some DnB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/raving-mad&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/raving-mad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is of my daughter&amp;rsquo;s teddy bear, from years ago when we took a train ride in northern New Hampshire. Tea and scones were absolutely had, at this simply fabulous tea party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track was pretty simple&amp;hellip; just did my vaporwave thing&amp;hellip; found four loops that seemed to work together&amp;hellip; though this admittedly took a while today&amp;hellip; because I tried five or six combinations that seemed fine, but when recorded as Lofi on the SP-202 and then slowed down they sounded quite poor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>#jamtember2021 Track - Always</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/09/12/jamtember2021-track-always/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3156</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mostly happy with how this track came out&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/always&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/always&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture is just of the SP-202&amp;hellip; just thought it looked kinda cool all lit up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The track itself came together pretty quickly, though I did have to go tweak a number of samples once I ran it through YAM&amp;hellip; all of a sudden I was noticing all kinds of clipping and noise. The atmospheric sound at the beginning was full of so many pops and clips. I didn&amp;rsquo;t remove all of them, but definitely reduced it a bit by just tweaking the program. The bass was just super noisy, probably as a result from having run it through the SP-202 a bit, so I had to drop a LPF on it to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3145</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just another quick one&amp;hellip; really dug the time stretched loop and figured I&amp;rsquo;d drop another quick sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/check-your-inbox&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/check-your-inbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, just worked through sampling a few loops into the SP 202, then PITCH and FILTER 1 to taste, and then running it through the SP 303 for some extra flavor as usual. Hype came in for the rescue for a few other sounds just to round it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=3126</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This one was a blast to put together&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ash-left-on-my-face&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ash-left-on-my-face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image is a photoshop filter on a record. So nothing&amp;hellip; exactly exciting&amp;hellip; but well&amp;hellip; whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this track together was a bit of work digging for samples and finding stuff that I liked. The hardest thing was actually pulling the bass together. Originally I had a non stop sound, and was applying different gated filters, and it just felt wrong. Like it should belong to an electronic or techno sound. It was nice by itself, but just not for this track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just knocking something out fairly quickly over lunch for day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is from years ago&amp;hellip; Aruba I think? I&amp;rsquo;ll have to look it up and see if I can figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the track, I did another fake 4 bar loop to turn into a vaporwave track. So quite similar process to the last few days. The big difference here is *way* more automation, filtering, and for the first half of the song I used the Air Halfspeed plugin to make the vaporwave component feel slower. The whole track was going much much slower than I usually go for, so I really just tried to lock in what felt like a leaned way back vibe and go with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well today I felt like messing around with making a vaporwave styled song&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another picture courtesy of my trip to Hawaii. Really gorgeous island, and could definitely just hang out at the beach for days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make vaporwave you usually take some old 80&amp;rsquo;s music, find a loop, time stretch it way down, and then drop a beat on top of it&amp;hellip; maybe some filtering, reverb, or other fx to boot, but the idea is super easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expecting today to be a bit crazy, and I woke up early. So got the dogs out, and decided to get to business. Dogs out at 6:00am, fed, and in front of the MPC by 6:10am. Looking at the clock now and it is 6:52am. So factoring for upload time and stuff&amp;hellip; I guess a 35 minute track from start to finish?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes from my trip with my family to Hawaii. Was taking an early morning walk with my wife and saw the bird up in the tree. Not sure what kind of bird it is, but it was definitely striking!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did some of the work yesterday for this track&amp;hellip; just happened to have some extra time to kick it off. Then today&amp;hellip; happened. A lot going on, but I really wanted to get some more going for the track by adding a few more sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is from Hawaii, and I had gotten my wife a coconut to drink. She loves it&amp;hellip; I keep trying to drink coconut water, but frankly it is not for me. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is healthy, but just not my thing. My wife can drink it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner though!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Had a slightly longer lunch break than intended, but came to this track as an end point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture is another one from the walk. Just some train tracks that I had to walk over, and look like a good time to snap a quick picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly though, what I had for lunch. Chicken Tikka Masala, and boy did it hit the spot! Sure it was store bought, packaged, and needed to be reheated, but it is what I had available at the time, or I could have had some fajita leftovers, but I think I am saving those for tonight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
