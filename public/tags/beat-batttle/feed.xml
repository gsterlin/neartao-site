      <description>&lt;p&gt;The beat battle is active for another couple days, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=198305&amp;amp;start=15&#34;&gt;BB 280&lt;/a&gt;. The rules are pretty simple, just use the two samples provided, and no outside content. Also, a 1:30 time cap, so no run on pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image comes from a picture I took while on a work trip to Bangalore. Which reminds me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a couple of hours and created a lot of different sequences to play with. Some of the components vibed better than others together. Parts were either too high energy or too low energy, so I ended up taking the components I liked the most and putting them together into something that I felt was as coherent as possible without killing a lot of time on this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to get back into flipping samples again lately, and done a few other beat battles. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll post them. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in seeing some of the discussion and submissions check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=197867&#34;&gt;MPC Forums BB 279 Thread&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely a lot of good content there, and some really great flips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach has been to just spend 60-90 minutes on each battle, so instead of trying to get a full track or perfect mix, just go for speed of getting something workable and putting it together quickly. This battle was no different, and while I&amp;rsquo;m not excited for the track exactly, it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
