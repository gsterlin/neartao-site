My goal was to publish a track to soundcloud, that no matter how good or bad, I was putting something up.¬†Trust me, there are some stinkers up there, but I also managed to put some content up that I think sounds great and stands on its own pretty well!

    <p>Last day for #jamuary2021‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôm happy to look towards doing some more music still, but probably at a slower pace so that I can focus on tracks a bit more.

The picture is of the fire pit that we built‚Ä¶ going to miss it when we move to the new house, but we‚Äôll create another one :D
The track came together pretty quickly while I was watching my daughter play the sims, make a character of me‚Ä¶ who she promptly made broke, and then I guess I was then homeless. She had my avatar doing a lot of weird things. It makes me wonder what my daughter thinks of me sometimes.

I dunno‚Ä¶ not much to say about the track today. I was trying to get a hip hop/pop (hip pop?) style track going‚Ä¶ and I feel like this is where the track a day is an impediment‚Ä¶ I just need more time to work through it, but I ended up spending about half the day with my parents‚Ä¶ hadn‚Äôt seen them since before December‚Ä¶ and they only live about 40 or 50 minutes away.

The picture is from my daughter playing piano for a recital. It was‚Ä¶ three years ago now? She‚Äôs been learning to play piano for five or six years now, and knows far more about playing music than I do. She can sight read, has very good finger posture, and knows her way around the keys. On the other hand, I try and talk to her about sampling, beat making, song structure, and these are things she doesn‚Äôt know how to do. Occasionally we will talk and bounce ideas off of each other, but she‚Äôs not into creating songs, just more interested in reproducing them right now.

    <p>For day 27‚Ä¶ I missed the mark‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/broken-garage
So not really a garage‚Ä¶ but boy was that toy for my daughter busted. I ended up upgrading it with a bunch of additions like a tiny and working tv inside, fixed up the doorbell, it was a pretty rocking little house. When we got it though, it was broken as heck‚Ä¶
Kind of like the song I put together. I was kind of thinking about going for a House track‚Ä¶ and as you listen to it you can tell I kind of split between an acid baseline, and some other sounds in there‚Ä¶ and never really committed to a garage track, or a UK track‚Ä¶ or anything else. It straddles the line, but not in a good way. I suspect I need to burn this track with fire‚Ä¶ but today I had been working on two or three other tracks to started out with‚Ä¶ and just never was happy with anything. I guess not every day can be decent or above.

    <p>Day 23‚Ä¶ just a handful more to put together to wrap up the month!
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/foundation
The picture is from a trip to Puerto Rico‚Ä¶ probably around twenty years ago now. Just a quick snap that I took while driving by the beach. The water down there is amazing!
Putting the track together, I figured I‚Äôd work on something a bit more experimental, so not quite so traditional drums and sounds, and just see how it came together. Overall, I am relatively happy with it, but the mixing seems off. I spent some time trying to adjust the levels, but I think there‚Äôs some EQ and filtering that would need to be done to really make the track pop. I did my best by ear, but I got stuck in a few areas where having some visuals to go with the EQ to see where harmonics are probably would have helped be a bit more precise, instead of just using a low pass and high pass filter to just remove sounds completely.

The pictures is of a family friend‚Äôs dog, that just looked super evil for the day. I might have to play with the picture again, because it could really turn into something special. Not today though‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs just about time to start preparing for tomorrow!
This track is just a straight up noisy DnB track‚Ä¶ I initially wasn‚Äôt intending to get so gritty but everything just kind of fell into place that way. I had a ton more FX I had layered in, but had a bit of a hard time figuring out if you can automate turning FX on and off (turns out as far as I can tell you cannot).
