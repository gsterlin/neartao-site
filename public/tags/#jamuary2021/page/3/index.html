The picture is from one of my trips to the Czech Republic‚Ä¶ forget when‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs definitely a lot of stunning architecture out there, and absolutely worth checking out. About a third of the organization that I used to manage was out there, so I‚Äôd probably be out there two to three times a year to check in on everybody, see how things were going, get feedback, and make sure the the remote team members knew that I was a living and breathing human being.

The image is from a trip years ago that we took our daughter to the Boston Commons and is of the paddle boat that you can take a little tour around the duck pond. Our daughter was never super excited to get on the boat, and I‚Äôm not sure we ever did at that age, now she‚Äôs probably too old to think it would be something fun to do. Honestly, having done the ride before myself, it‚Äôs a little pricey, and you don‚Äôt really get too much excitement out of it.

Boy, the picture is from about four years ago‚Ä¶ Amy is looking impressively squinty‚Ä¶ might have been from the flash, I don‚Äôt really recall. Looked like a goofy enough picture to work with for today‚Äôs track though. She‚Äôs watching you!
Today I took my own personal advice from yesterday and only applied transposes to the track level, and not the sequence level of the song. I figured that way I‚Äôm not having drums hop all over the place and can have some more control over what is going on. It was a little bit more work, but it wasn‚Äôt insurmountable.

Putting this track together was fun‚Ä¶ but I did struggle a bit (again) with audio tracks, external midi, and exporting the file. I know I grumbled about this before, but Akai really needs to get an ability to mix in from the inputs for a track if/when you need to. I suppose posting everything to audio tracks is fine, but the workflow is just wonky to me. I‚Äôll quit my belly aching on it, but it did lead to a bit of a mess uploading a track that was missing a core synth part. On the pro soundcloud account it‚Äôs not a *huge* problem to replace a track, but boy was it funny to go back and listen to the track and notice it was missing. It‚Äôs something I can fix in my on process for creating and publishing songs, but‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a hassle. Also‚Ä¶ to be fair, even if there was a checkbox to use external gear to get it in from the inputs I‚Äôd probably still complain about it being a problem because then I‚Äôd probably double up sounds, or cause myself other problems. Maybe it is fine Akai? Maybe! This is just something that‚Äôs been such an ingrained workflow in DAWs though, that it does lead me to at least one area where the MPC in standalone isn‚Äôt quite enough as a DAW. Everything inside the box it is cool, but exporting out content it doesn‚Äôt work quite so hot. /grumbling off‚Ä¶

The picture is from some resin structures we made as a family this year. My dad was all about how copper killed COVID or something silly, so he sent us some. I didn‚Äôt buy into it, and I don‚Äôt think he did either, but we ended up all doing remote family molds to just try and make something interesting. I had never poured resin like this before, so it was interesting at least to see the process up close and personal.

    <p>Well it looks like I am back for another month of jamming out!
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/requiem-for-a-soul
First off, the picture is of my oldest dog, Amy (pronounced Emmy). I was trying to find a picture that might feel a little dreamy, where you might not quite know what was going on, was maybe a little shocking, but not really in the terrifying space. This was a picture from taking Amy home from being spayed, and we had to put the cone on her head to keep her from licking the wound. She is by no means intimidating, and is actually one of the sweetest dogs you could find, but this picture does make her look a little haunted.
