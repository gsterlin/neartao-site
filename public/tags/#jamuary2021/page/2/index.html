The painting is from when I used to record art lessons and post them online‚Ä¶ I think I did about 100 episodes, under the title ‚ÄúPainting in Five‚Äù. This particular one was showing how to paint out a rough sketch, and I‚Äôm quite certain it was based off of the lion from the MCM Grand. At any rate, the idea was to just show people how to quickly get some things down without thinking too much about whether it was good or bad. And now‚Ä¶ about twenty years later, I am doing a track a day just to get myself to put something down. Maybe I should bring back the ‚ÄúIn Five‚Äù concept in the blog? I‚Äôve been thinking about it, but haven‚Äôt committed to anything yet.

The picture comes courtesy of my back yard. Well I sold my house, so technically now it is the new owner‚Äôs back yard, but I am currently still living here. Setup a lease back arrangement while I am waiting on the new place. About a month to a month and a half to go‚Ä¶ and believe me, I am ready‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs about time to get my damn music studio back together so I can get access to sounds that I want when I want them. That said, it‚Äôs been quite nice to be working with a greatly reduced set of sound sources‚Ä¶ so it hasn‚Äôt been an issue by any stretch of the imagination.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/high-and-tight
The picture is from a game of air hockey with my daughter from years ago. Something we used to do a lot at the local kid casino‚Ä¶ but she is too old for that now :D.
The track was made using drums from MPC Tutor‚Äôs latest drum kit‚Ä¶ The Underground Crates. If you‚Äôre looking for some new drums definitely check it out. I‚Äôm digging this MPC Expansion so far, and can see it having a lot of mileage. The rest of the track is just a chopped up bass and chopped up guitar sample. Nothing too exciting‚Ä¶ and I had a vocal track with it, but it was just too much. I ended up just going for keeping this track simple and chilled out today‚Ä¶ so it isn‚Äôt exactly special‚Ä¶ but I really liked how chilled out and fun it sounded.

    <p>Day 17‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/fears-for-tears
The picture is from a painting I did years ago‚Ä¶ I think I gave it to my mom? *shrug*‚Ä¶ somebody probably still has it.
This track came together pretty fast. I started with a pretty basic drum beat and bass line, and tweaked the FX, pitch, etc‚Ä¶ a bit to get a bit more of an interesting sound. It wasn‚Äôt long before I added in the piano. This is just a chopped up loop, and I decided to do something different, and work on make a 32 bar playing of the chops, instead of doing my usual 4 or 8 bar play through and then working with the loops. I‚Äôm going to have to consider this in the future, as it was both fun to see different ways I could utilize the sample, but I also got a few interesting places I normally wouldn‚Äôt get to.

    <p>Day 16‚Ä¶ it may be cold outside but it is getting warm in here‚Ä¶
https://soundcloud.com/neartao/almost-there
The picture is a chocolate cake we had for Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶ really good‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm pretty sure my wife picked it up at Whole Foods‚Ä¶ if I remember correctly.
For the track it‚Äôs another mix of chops and synths‚Ä¶ and auto sampling‚Ä¶ and mistakes. I spent a lot of time looking for sounds that I felt would work together, so this track feels pretty good. Normally I‚Äôd upload the auto sampled synth‚Ä¶ but it has echo in it‚Ä¶ making me have to record every single note for the group, and then this makes it hard to use outside of a 96bpm standpoint‚Ä¶ as well‚Ä¶ it also only works for the notes I sampled which‚Ä¶ put it in the rather not so useful category for a general standpoint. I may try and find a good delay/reverb match to make it into a generic MPC patch‚Ä¶ but for now it just felt kind of strange to upload something so rigid and honestly kind of single purpose.

The picture‚Ä¶ I believe is from Disney, from the animal park resort. I am pretty sure I mentioned how much my daughter loved that trip. We had a blast, and it was great to see all of the different animals.
This track is a mix of chops, and synths. I started by chopping up a break, and then moved on to finding some guitar sounds to fill out some of what I thought was going to be a lead and the bass‚Ä¶ but well‚Ä¶ the bass sound was decidedly not inspiring‚Ä¶ and I kind of drowned up the guitar sound in a lot of this track with some of the synths (whoops). So not the end of the world, and something that could be patched up with some mixing, but my intent here was to work on keeping things in key, or as in key as I could without totally knowing what I was doing.

The picture is a sunrise from the other day while I was on my way to take the dogs out for a walk. It is absolutely the best thing about this track.
So what happened? Well‚Ä¶ I wanted to try to do some production on a different machine‚Ä¶ and figured I‚Äôd dig up my MPC 500. You know‚Ä¶ the one I have only goofed around with once in a while over the last few years, so pretty much forgot how to do everything on it that I wanted.

I tried to slow the track down here‚Ä¶ and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ I kind of like the sound of it, but you can tell just listening to it I drifted off into some mental space that wasn‚Äôt so focussed on the track‚Ä¶ I suspect this is what happens for creating a new track a day for a month and a half.
