      <description>&lt;p&gt;The initial repair has shown that the previously busted up Akai MPC 500 has in fact been noisy mostly from the obliterated Volume and Q-Link board. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to use it for a few days, but the next problem that has surfaced has been that some of the tact switches have been a bit finicky, and require multiple presses to get them to register a press on occasion. This is super annoying, and definitely slows down your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a few days back I posted about picking up an &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/block-editor/post/neartao.wordpress.com/620&#34;&gt;Akai MPC 500 on Reverb&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; and it was absolutely a mess inside. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t see it, I&amp;rsquo;ll post a picture below, but it was all jacked up. I suspect something heavy was dropped on it, or some other excessive amount of force. Maybe you can help decide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/99d1f477-1d68-410d-afad-a60e004da54c%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it was busted enough to snap the PCB in several places, and you can see where the metal frame got bent as well. Yesterday I picked up some Krazy Glue in preparation for the attempt for a big fix. I figured that particular glue would likely be the best way to hope to put the PCB back together as it does a really solid job bonding plastics. On the negative side, I am always getting this stuff stuck to my fingers and all over the place&amp;hellip; so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exact thrilled to be working with it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
