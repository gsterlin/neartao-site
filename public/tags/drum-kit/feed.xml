&lt;p&gt;For those of you who are hitting issues with Akai MPC 2.10 Firmware and using track mutes going to the same Drum Kit or Key Group, I have come up with a solution using Midi programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to follow along with my setup the project is available here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mpc-2-10-firmwre-drum-kit-track-test.zip&#34;&gt;MPC 2-10 Firmwre Drum Kit Track Test&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mpc-2-10-firmwre-drum-kit-track-test.zip&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sequence 01 has all of the tracks 01-10 pointing at the same drum kit, while Sequence 02 has all of the tracks 01-10 setup as midi tracks and sending their midi data to track 16 which is a drum kit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Sample Pack] Time Out</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/03/06/sample-pack-time-out/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Sample Pack was first published to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/neartao&#34;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;. Head over there if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn about getting early access to the Sample Packs I am putting together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this Drum Kit together with the intent of making it quite noisy in mind.  It&amp;rsquo;s a bit more of a harsh industrial kind of sound, so you&amp;rsquo;re likely going to want to apply effects to tame these sounds a bit.  A lot of what makes it rough was running the sounds through sample frequency reduction and a pretty heavy level of compression.  This gives the tails of the sounds an especially unnatural nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[Sample Pack] Harmful</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2021/02/27/sample-pack-nt-kit-harmful/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A drum kit I put together using a few scripts I threw together to try and help package all of this content up a bit neater so I can focus more on the samples and post content.  Right now I know I&amp;rsquo;m not writing anything terribly interesting, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the demo tracks I&amp;rsquo;m putting together show off the sample packs a bit.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be considering documenting up the process to get the samples together, but then again, maybe it isn&amp;rsquo;t terribly interesting.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;A pad I put together as my first pass at making an BY-SA key group.  Definitely going to need to make some tools to simplify the process, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see how it works out after doing the next three sample packs for the month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This Sample Pack is intended as a drum kit that I put together as my first pass at making a BY-SA licensed Sample Pack.  Definitely going to need to make some tools to simplify the process, but I&amp;rsquo;ll need to see how it works out after doing the next three sample packs for the month before I get too ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
