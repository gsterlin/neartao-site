      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I was traveling to Bangalore for work Chase Bliss dropped the Generation Loss, and unfortunately I missed the pre-order window on Reverb. I tried to check it out the next day, but it was already sold out. I spent the next few days wondering if I really needed this device, or it was going to be an effect I should just pass on. I checked out the Knobs &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPONrJAyqfc&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; as well as Andy Othling&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2g-xM7Oj4k&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; and I have to say, they both intrigued me. So I setup a feed on Reverb to keep me apprised of whenever Generation Loss might start showing up on the scalper market on Reverb and eBay.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
