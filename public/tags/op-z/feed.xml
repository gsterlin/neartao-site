      <description>&lt;p&gt;The oplab module for my OP-Z finally showed up today. I ordered it back in July, and it&amp;rsquo;s been backordered for quite some time. I read on the op-forums people having problems with the oplab latch, warped cases, etc&amp;hellip; so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally sure how it was going to work out. I was certainly concerned that the oplab would not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut to the next fifteen minutes after installing the oplab module, and the best I could get out of it was a red flash, and then none of the blinking lights to show activity I expected. I tried hooking up the oplab outputs to various inputs on my eurorack, and wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to see any output triggering on my oscilloscope, gate triggers, or anything else. That was disappointing. I uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, tried squeezing the case in case there was a connection issue&amp;hellip; none of this helped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
