      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like the more teams I work with, the more friends and family I have, the more messaging clients I need to work with. Over the years I have been on many services including iMessage, ICQ, AOL Messenger, Google Chat, WhatsApp, Telegram, IRC, Slack, and many more. There are in fact so many messaging applications, that I am not going to bother to list them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you can load all of the local apps, but anybody who has tried doing this knows that you end up with a mess in your taskbar, and worse, trying to mute messages can be a real chore when you are in a meeting because you may have 10+ services that need to be silenced.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
