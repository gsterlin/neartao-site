    <p>This track was fun, but I also had a lot more time today to be picky with sound selection, make some various sections, and then add in eurorack for some extra spice.
https://youtu.be/frcc_5iL7yo
This track started from the much cleaner track recorded on soundcloud that I did pretty much everything on the MPC, and then just ran it through and end chain of SP-202 and SP-303. I actually made a few other tracks that didn‚Äôt make the cut because they just clashed a bit too much with everything going on here.

What all is going on? The picture comes from Neural Blender again‚Ä¶ still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it‚Äôs definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.
Well‚Ä¶ the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its‚Äô range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly &#43;4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela‚Äôs New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.

This is my pretty traditional setup I‚Äôve been going for lately, but with the SP 202 and SP 303 added to the end of the chain‚Ä¶ oh and I‚Äôve added in the Zoom H6 at the end of chain to function a bit as a mixer/audio router‚Ä¶ the RCA to 1/4&#34; adaptors are what is causing me the biggest headache in this setup‚Ä¶ but it is kind of nice having the 202 do LPF duties at the end of the chain, and then the Vinyl FX from the 303 to do some compression and wow/flutter duties‚Ä¶ and a hint of vinyl noise.

For this track I disconnected the entire hot mess from a couple days ago‚Ä¶ and just really went to focus on basics. I decided I wanted to try recording in a few chords into the Morphagene and then using Pam‚Äôs New Workout on a random LFO to send a change to which splice was selected‚Ä¶ and it works pretty nicely except for one problem. The Morphagene doesn‚Äôt switch to the next sound until partway through playing‚Ä¶ so either I need to work out clocking issues, or change config.txt settings or‚Ä¶ something. It works fine for this track more or less, but required some playing around and bumbling around to get some rhythm that sounded like it could work with it.

Alright putting this track together was a pain‚Ä¶ I had too many different elements going on, and out of the *nine* recording attempts‚Ä¶ only one was halfway decent. My biggest problem is that about a third of what I put together just didn‚Äôt mesh with the other parts of the track. I‚Äôd keep recording and trying to decide which way to go with it, but it just wasn‚Äôt happening. The synth lines didn‚Äôt gel, the Lofi arps didn‚Äôt gel, it just didn‚Äôt want to come together.

For this track I built it up off of 16 clips from an expansion, made sure to use each one‚Ä¶ and then did a track explode on the MPC, set the pads 1-8 to output to 5/6 (and thus on the bottom chain of FX of the eurorack), and set pads 9-16 to output to 3/4 (the top chain of FX of the eurorack).
Mostly me just using track mutes from here, and then turning knobs on the eurorack to jam out, cut up, glitch, and otherwise morph and destroy the various elements of the track that are playing. A few places feel like they didn‚Äôt quite work, but hey‚Ä¶ gotta try right?!

    <p>Alright, it‚Äôs Beatober and time to try and focus a bit more on beats again. Just trying to kick the tires on a stringing a single song together between the Eurorack and Akai MPC Live mk2.

The picture is just from my dog being sleepy on the chair beside me. Felt like a good chill out song and she‚Äôs not chilling out much more than this.
As far as putting this all together‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been slowly building out the rack patch, and I setup the Akai MPC outputs 3/4 as the drums going through the top of the rack, and outputs 5/6 for the piano and bass on the bottom of the rack. This is then all going into the ST Mix for mixing a somewhat clean signal together with a copied and glitched out signal. There‚Äôs a lot of knobs to be trying to keep in mind while also muting and unmuting parts, so I probably just need to work out my process a bit more consciously to keep it all in my head.

    <p>Last track/jam for the month‚Ä¶ going to see what I can put together for beatober next :D
https://youtu.be/in3OUNSvj6U
Last time messing around for the month, and wanted to fix up a few things on my patching. For this, I ended up just doing two different track ideas and routing one track through 3/4 of the MPC, and the second track through 5/6 of the MPC. This then went into both the Morphagenes, mostly because it was already hooked up this way. In fact, I tried to mostly use what I‚Äôve been building up for a patch over the last two days, but I did straighten out my mixer to have the ST Mix have 1) Track 1 FX chain A 2) Track 1 FX chain B 3) Track 2 FX chain A 4) Track 2 FX chain B. This helped me keep some sanity for which ST Mix knobs were controlling which parts of the sound.
