    <p>And now for something completely different.
Today I just decided to do what I could with the pocket operators I have on hand‚Ä¶ PO-32, PO-33, PO-35‚Ä¶ and see what would come from it. I‚Äôll definitely get back to the MPC Live and Eurorack, but just needed a change of pace for a bit. Probably will do another PO track or two for the time being and go for something a bit longer, I suspect.

This week‚Äôs challenge on STBB Forever is #697 - Claude Debussy. Rules were pretty open, go find your own Claude sounds. I ended up listening to a *lot* of this Youtube track
I didn‚Äôt listen to the whole thing, but I did consume a lot of it. There is a lot of great music in here.

This is a track I have been working on for about a week on the PO-33. All the sampling and mixing was done within the little box. I continue to like this little device because it really forces you to think about a potentially crippling amount of sampling time and a very real four note polyphony limit. Some of the previous tracks I have done really ran into the polyphony wall, and it doesn‚Äôt exactly drop notes the way I would expect at least.

This track comes courtesy of STBB Forever BB #695, there were two tracks to chop up. The rules were effectively to chop whatever, use your own drums, no external instruments, and you needed to drop a change up in the track. I‚Äôm interested to see what others do this week.
Similar to the MPC BB this week, I was really crunched for time to work on this. This time however I decided I would just do the track in the PO-33, and make it a quick flip. So I loaded the tracks into the MPC, but didn‚Äôt even bother chopping on the MPC, I just shuffled the starting point around the tracks and sampled in what ever I wanted to start or stop, and was able to get four or five interesting chops pretty quickly from the first track. For the second track, I just sampled roughly a loop, and let the auto chopper do it‚Äôs magic, or horrible destruction.

This picture comes courtesy of Photoshop Camera on the iPhone with one of the goofy filters. I was out RV‚Äôing with my family and my parents for a couple of days over the weekend‚Ä¶ which held me up from having time to pull together more of a track. I was split on the track this week, and was messing around on Sunday afternoon on the MPC, and the yesterday I flipped to try to put a track together on the PO-33.

    <p>If you can believe it‚Ä¶ this came as a result of two different tracks built pretty much at the same time on the PO-33. This one was made up of 12 patterns, the other one used the other 4 to mess around (I‚Äôll post the other track below). The same samples led to completely different inspirations.
https://youtu.be/BRw5bR-GOIU
I‚Äôm not entirely sure that I‚Äôll keep doing these kinds of visual videos or not‚Ä¶ it added a bit more production time to something I just wanted to goof around with. Plus, since it was posted (a month ago) it‚Äôs only gotten one view‚Ä¶ so yeah‚Ä¶ not terribly popular. It was fun to play around with the software on my iPad though, so I suppose it isn‚Äôt a complete loss. I‚Äôll just need to keep my mind open and learn.

    <p>I‚Äôm not really happy with this, but I also had a bit of a gap for #Jamuary. Guess it was too much to think I‚Äôd put something together every day. On the other hand, it is freeing to have just taken a few takes, and going for the best of them so that I can move on.
There really isn‚Äôt anything too special here, and I actually sampled way more than I ended up using. Some of the other tracks I‚Äôve posted I‚Äôve been thinking of going back and actually tracking them out and mixing them up a bit, but this one I was super into last week, and now it just kind of falls flat for me.

    <p>The image is courtesy of a road trip I did with my family from the East Coast out to Montana. On the way back we stopped at an amethyst mine, and I got some really cool pictures of some older beat up vehicles. There was some really cool stuff going on here, and we got some neat amethyst crystals to bring back home with us.
As for the song, nothing too fancy here, just using samples of thumps and bumps from everyday objects. A lot of the magic is just pitching things up and down, using filters‚Ä¶ and then just jamming it out. I‚Äôm going to stick with the PO-33 a bit longer, but a lot of the initial magic playing around with the FX again is a bit gone, it has now gone from being novel to producing some pretty similar sounds to my ear. The device is still fantastic, and it might just be time for me start considering what I am going to move on to for a device to keep going on making tracks.

Funny thing‚Ä¶ I was going to do another house track, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd place it quite in that genre, is it electro house? I don‚Äôt think it is fast enough for Techno‚Ä¶ Somebody who has more refined taste might be able to clarify the music genre for me. I just thought it sounded cool!
