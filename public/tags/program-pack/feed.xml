      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just testing a few things on the VX90/S950 combo setup and figured I would record off a few key groups to see how things were sounding. Below are the files if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in checking them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that Cherry Crush was the first key group that I recorded yesterday after getting everything setup and working again. I recorded a sample into the S950 and then worked on tweaking the filter and resonance to see what kind of sweet spots I could find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
