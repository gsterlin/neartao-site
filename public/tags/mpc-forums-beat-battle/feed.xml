      <title>MPC Forums Beat Battle #321 - How You Flop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, shout out to MPC Forums, and check out the Beat Battle #321 thread if you want to see what others are up to at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&#34;&gt;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=212572&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess this track was about 90 minutes to put together? A lot of the time was spent chopping, and then finding different lines. I gave a stab at an initial 8 bar sequence and figured it was okay enough. I know I normally go at this as one long sequence, but I really want the sound to change over the course of the track, so although each 8 bar sequence could more or less stand on it&amp;rsquo;s own, I felt it would be fun to make a few different once and then use song mode (for once) to chain them together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just dropping this here&amp;hellip; had fun&amp;hellip; but a super quick one&amp;hellip; maybe 30 minutes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, an MPC Forums Beat Battle&amp;hellip; I honed in on a section that I thought would loop well enough, chopped it up, and then focussed on the chops that sounded good enough. This track turned into three different sections that I just used song mode to string together. Was a fun track to flip, even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly spend a ton of time working on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Submission for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&amp;amp;t=210474&amp;amp;p=1825311#p1825311&#34;&gt;MPC Beat Battle 303&lt;/a&gt; over at MPC Forums. You still have time to submit a track :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture comes courtesy of a trip I took with my family and in-laws to a butterfly garden when the kids were just two or three. The girls really loved seeing all the insects in their natural habitat. Especially since it was winter outside, and in some sections nearly tropical from the level of humidity. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to see the life cycle of these sometimes so foreign creatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just through this track together in an hour for the MPC Beat Battle 302.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb302-take-it-easy-on-you&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb302-take-it-easy-on-you&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about to go to bed&amp;hellip; not sure I could&amp;rsquo;ve cut this more to the wire&amp;hellip; but&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; I got close lol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just drums from outside&amp;hellip; everything else was sampled from the track with an application of vigorous effects and automation where I felt I could get away with it and still have a cohesive track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dropping off a track for MPC Forums Beat Battle #299&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rolled this track together in what&amp;hellip; less than an hour I think? I just did lazy/manual chops by playing the track and tapping out the pads&amp;hellip; I know it&amp;rsquo;s a bit sloppy, but honestly it sounded fine, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking to make a masterpiece. From there I knocked out a bit of drums to just have something to flip to, and was off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MPCBB 268 - Relaxing Action</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/12/25/mpcbb-268-relaxing-action/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t any other entries, so I figured what the heck and put together a track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sample itself was pretty basic, so I figured I would work on chopping it up and just finding a drum kit to play to it. I wanted to focus as much as possible on keeping the original audio track playing throughout the track without it sounding too repetitive, this meant making variations to work through, and seeing what worked. Ultimately I wanted some of the shorter chops to play longer through this process, so a quick detune of 6 semitones had me pretty well sorted so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any gaps of silence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Track - MPCBB289 - Long Way to Go</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/08/26/track-mpcbb289-long-way-to-go/</link>

&lt;p&gt;A bit of a scramble this one&amp;hellip; but had fun listening to the song and picking out the parts I liked. All done on the MPC Live mk2&amp;hellip; only software intervention was to load Fission so I could just cut the track to length and do a quick fade out. I promise :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around I tried to create 3 different main sections, and then worked through drops, buildups and such to get the track together. Then just strung them together in song mode. It was a bit of a hassle because I exploded a few too many tracks in spots, and then from section to section they didn&amp;rsquo;t line up&amp;hellip; add to this that I did not name any of the tracks properly, and it made for a bit more confusion trying to create various sections. Worked out pretty quickly though, I&amp;rsquo;d say this track came together in two hours max.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Alrighty then! So for this track, I started it and finished it in about 30 minutes. I just didn&amp;rsquo;t have much time to hit the deadline yesterday&amp;hellip; and figured I&amp;rsquo;d just cut to the chase for the throw down. To pull this together I just grabbed a four bar section that I liked the sound of, chopped it, pitched it down, and then got to business laying out a track. I then searched through drums and kits to piece together something for drums, a little fx, and some bass that was halfway decent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
