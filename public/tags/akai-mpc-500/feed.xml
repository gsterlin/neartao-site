      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mpc-bible&#34;&gt;MPC Bible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will absolutely, highly, emphatically&amp;hellip; suggest checking out (i.e. purchasing) MPC Tutor&amp;rsquo;s excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mpc-samples.com/product.php/104/beat-making-on-the-mpc500/&#34;&gt;Beat Making on the MPC500&lt;/a&gt;. This will answer a ton of questions for you, and gives some great exercises to work through if you are unfamiliar with the workflow, or have questions that the MPC 500 Manual doesn&amp;rsquo;t answer. And there are a lot of things that aren&amp;rsquo;t terribly clear in Akai&amp;rsquo;s MPC 500 Manual. Plus the Bible comes with some samples, so it will help get you off the ground and running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ooo&amp;hellip; this is bad&amp;hellip; like&amp;hellip; probably the worst thing I threw against the wall&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/what-the&#34;&gt;https://soundcloud.com/neartao/what-the&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture is a sunrise from the other day while I was on my way to take the dogs out for a walk. It is absolutely the best thing about this track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened? Well&amp;hellip; I wanted to try to do some production on a different machine&amp;hellip; and figured I&amp;rsquo;d dig up my MPC 500. You know&amp;hellip; the one I have only goofed around with once in a while over the last few years, so pretty much forgot how to do everything on it that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai MPC 500 Tact Switches</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The initial repair has shown that the previously busted up Akai MPC 500 has in fact been noisy mostly from the obliterated Volume and Q-Link board. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to use it for a few days, but the next problem that has surfaced has been that some of the tact switches have been a bit finicky, and require multiple presses to get them to register a press on occasion. This is super annoying, and definitely slows down your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Akai MPC 500 Repair</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/07/03/akai-mpc-500-repair/</link>

       <guid isPermaLink="false">https://neartao.com/?p=644</guid> 
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a few days back I posted about picking up an &lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/block-editor/post/neartao.com/620&#34;&gt;Akai MPC 500 on Reverb&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; and it was absolutely a mess inside. In case you didn&amp;rsquo;t see it, I&amp;rsquo;ll post a picture below, but it was all jacked up. I suspect something heavy was dropped on it, or some other excessive amount of force. Maybe you can help decide?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/99d1f477-1d68-410d-afad-a60e004da54c%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, it was busted enough to snap the PCB in several places, and you can see where the metal frame got bent as well. Yesterday I picked up some Krazy Glue in preparation for the attempt for a big fix. I figured that particular glue would likely be the best way to hope to put the PCB back together as it does a really solid job bonding plastics. On the negative side, I am always getting this stuff stuck to my fingers and all over the place&amp;hellip; so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t exact thrilled to be working with it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
