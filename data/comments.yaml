    If you're handy with a soldering iron it really isn't too bad of a repair.  Depending on how your board broke you might be able to manage soldering at the broken joints instead of having to bridge the gaps with wires like I did.

    Good luck!

  content: "While the MPC 1k, 2.5k, and 500 all share a similar processor and CPU, so *technically* a form of JJOS could be ported over, my understanding is that JJ never had access to the build tools or encryption routines for the 500, or other things necessary to actually bring a form of JJOS to the MPC 500.  So unfortunately you have what you have on the MPC 500.  If you are looking for JJOS features, at roughly the same size, your best bet would be to invest in the MPC 1k.  \n\nGood luck!"

  content: NearTao, I would of just commented on one of your many YouTube vids but I couldn't find any 500 posts. I had a question, is it possible to just trigger the 500 stop start sequence? Or to change the "ext" tempo to its own independent tempo when syncing? Was trying to purchase another 500 and treat it like a 2nd sequence feature but maybe I shouldn't lol? Any info would be def be appreciated.

    You wouldn't be able to recreate those sounds alone on the VX-90, as I used the S950 as the oscillator, and the VX-90 was doing the filter/envelope work for some if not all of those patches that I recorded.

    I might be able to take some time to go through the VX-90 again and do a bit of a deeper dive of it.  Right now I've been pretty focussed on the Roland SP-404 mk2, but it could be fun to go back to the VX-90 and see what I can come up with.

    Did you ever try making anything on it, or backup to tape any of your presets to tape?

    Thanks for the FAST reply. I only modified presets and learned some things bout the filters and envelopes. I never really got the hang of creating anything from scratch. I seem to be incapable of getting a simple sign-wave out of it. I'm just too terrible with parameters like "VCOaPWMS," "VCF KEYF," and the complex interworking of the envelope parameters. More often then not I get no sound unless I start with someone else's patch as a starting point.

    After I changed the battery about a couple years ago, I lost all presets. Starting with a clean slate, I found some patch recipes for it on the internet (link below). Those 20 sounds are the best I've ever gotten out of it! But that leaves me with about 80 empty slots.

  content: I've been the proud owner of a VX90 since I spent all my car fund on it when I was 15 (30 years ago). My mom was furious. I loved it but never really understood it. I got to where I could modify the presets, but not really create anything from scratch. There's like zero help on the internet for patches to try. Since there's really only about 20 relevant parameters, I was wondering if you could most the settings for any of these sounds. They're cool!

  content: "Wanted to quickly mention that recording to banks C/D using the memory card significantly reduce the SP202's noise floor so that you have less high-pitched noise to eq out of your recordings (shown by non-juror on youtube). Also worth mention is that if you're sequencing from an MPC or other midi sequencer, the 202 responds to velocity with a value of 0 or 1-127. \n\nUnlike the 303 which uses WAV files, the 202 records in the old Roland proprietary RDAC file format for which there is some part of a decoder available at https://github.com/randygordon/rdac but it apparently requires you to use a hex editor and I just don't know enough about that to make it work. If someone figures it out, it will mean that you could put samples on the card or pull them off straight to a computer using a card reader.\n\nIt's awesome that you figured out how many semitones the pitch down effect spans, this should make it a lot easier to calculate and create a slightly faster than desired loop on a drum machine or modern sequencer, with the intent of recording that onto the 202 and then using the correlation between pitch and tempo, produce a pitched down output which is aligned with your desired project bpm.\n\nLook forward to seeing any updates."
