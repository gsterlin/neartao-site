Day 26 was a bit hard to pull together... several tracks started... and just couldn't commit to laying it down.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/listless-nights

The picture is just of the moon in my backyard... I was trying to test out my camera, and for the purposes of what I was trying to do, well it failed... or I need to learn more options for how to setup the camera on my phone... it's probably me... which should be the name for my next bad track.

This track started life as a 2 bar loop, which is pretty abnormal for my workflow... I just find it too constrained to really get anything moving. That's just me though. But I started working with weird noises and wasn't sure how I wanted to make things groove, so I kind of just went with it to get a few tracks moving around and trying it out. I pretty quickly doubled to 4 bars, and played out some more tracks, and then doubled to 16 bars to lay out the drums.

From there... well I did a double double to get to 64 bars... and then moved on to just recording track mutes. If you listen closely you can definitely here a few places where I apparently got bored and jumped the gun for doing the mutes and unmuted a little early, but nothing so horrible that made anything jarring... it just feels a tiny bit off... and since the whole track is kind of weird noise and of... I guess I was cool with it.

Anyways... overall I'm happy with how things came together... woo hoo.
