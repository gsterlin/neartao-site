I'm back at it for another round of sampling off of my trusty Akai S950... still working like a champ. Before getting into the details, here's the link.

[NT - S950 v3](/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v3-1.zip) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v3-1.zip)

Good news is that I am getting faster at sampling, but the bad news is that I made a mistake on a few of the programs and called them S95 instead of S950. This wasn't too big of a deal since the .xpm files are text editable since they are in a human readable format, but it was a bit of a chore to rename all of the samples, edit the file to do a search and replace of S95 to S950, and then hope everything worked out okay. Still, it wasn't so bad, and I have gotten some more samples together for your enjoyment.

One oddity that I have noticed is that based on how I have everything routed for audio, if I tap on my desk or wobble it a bit I am getting some stray audio distortion. It is something I had not noticed in the first two recording sessions, but I'll be keeping an eye out for it. I have a sneaking suspicion that it is related to the Spice, and the Korg NuTek tubes, because they have some weird knocking effects that if you tap on the case it can cause it to ring out noise. Strange, and it is not part of the audio chain, but it's possible I'm picking up some grounding or other noises, so it will be worth looking into at some point, but it wasn't something I figured I'd go back and re-record everything.

This volume is less programs and samples than the previous ones, but it's not for a lack of trying. It just so happens to be that this is the first volume with drum kits, and I had to knock out all of those pads by hand. If something sounds weird in one of the drum kits, it is probably my fault, and not the kits fault... feel free to blame me.

Overall notes for the auto sampling:  
\\* 430 Mono samples  
\\* Should play from C-2 to G8  
\\* Sampled C0 to C5 in most cases, with a stride of 4  
\\* Generally 16 samples per program  
\\* Only one Sample Layer at velocity of 127

16 programs, which breaks down to:

- 3 Bass
- 2 Drum Kits
- 1 Guitar
- 1 Percussion
- 2 Sax
- 6 String
- 1 Trombone

Enjoy, and have fun with these sounds!
