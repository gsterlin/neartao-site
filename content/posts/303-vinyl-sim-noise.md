A request over on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SP404/comments/uqbfvj/sp_303_vinyl_sim_req/) came in for some Vinyl Sim Noise recorded off of a 303. Why? I don't know... but maybe the user will provide some details.

To record this, I just hooked the 303 up to the 404 mk2, turned on the Vinyl Sim on the 303, turned off Compression and Wow, and did a few passes at Volume and Noise levels. After that, did the old record, and then exported to SD. Nothing fancy here... and with nothing else playing, at high levels it's pretty noisy. Didn't appear to be clipping on the mk2, so I think these should all be pretty clean... well as clean as it's going to get.

For those who want to nerd out with noise, eat your hearts out.
