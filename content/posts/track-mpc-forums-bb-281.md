This post is curtesy of the [MPC Forums Beat Battle 281](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=198504)!

So I was going to do a DnB track, but unfortunately pk1 posted one of his own tracks on accident. Sadly, no DnB track dropping for now. Here's the snippet of what I was messing around with in case you are interested. You can see, Amy is super thrilled for being in the picture!

Fortunately, I wasn't more than an hour into sampling and chopping, and had just started to sample a few instrument sounds. Check out the [Rezo Bass for the MPC X/Live/One](/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rezo-bass-mpc-x.zip), if you're looking for a bass sound that didn't even make it into the DnB track. I had literally just sampled it and saw the "oops" post. Anyways... somewhat of a lost opportunity as I had wanted to do a DnB track for a change, but also figured I had invested enough time and energy and wanted to go a different direction with the next track.

And what a doozy the actual track to remix is. It is pretty much layers of sound, and there isn't much to pick out for good one shots. Maybe a couple things at the start of the song, but yikes! For anybody interested, I decided to load up Ableton Live, and dust off Spleeter to split the tracks into Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Other. Yeah... kind of lame in some ways, but I didn't want to spend the day eq'ing, filter, or doing messy chops. As I have noted before, this does leave some spectral process sounding artifacts, but when you start bringing it back together into a mix you don't hear it quite so much.

From here, I got into chopping, picking out some drums, bass, and vocal sounds. Most of the chops are one shots, and I just applied liberal effects and fairly extreme pitch shifting to make the track. I wanted to settle on just a handful of sounds instead of trying to build out an entire massive kit for the track.

Today is kind of like a two for one I guess. Almost two tracks, one of which is more finished. Thanks everybody, peace!
