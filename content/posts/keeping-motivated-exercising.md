I have hit 20 consecutive days now of closing all three rings on my Apple Watch, and I am wondering how much further I will go. To skip a day or two is not that bad, especially when I go back and check out my move data from the last two years. I think I broke my move streak of what was three, or maybe it was five for the first time this month. Sure, it is a little sad that I had not been consistently exercising, but it is what I am doing today that is important.

On the other hand though, I am definitely not used to all of this activity and I can feel it in my muscles. My legs in particular have a pretty constant dull ache, and I am having to take some time to stretch throughout the day, otherwise I feel like everything is tightening up. This is progress though, and while I still haven’t really lost any weight, I can say that I am sleeping better.

I mentioned last week that I was having problems getting one of my dogs to walk. I’ve continued to take them out for walks, and I am making sure that they are getting at least a mile in a day. Some of the recent days have been pretty warm, so I am starting to get them an early morning 6am walk first thing in the morning before it really gets hot. This has been a little troublesome, since the dogs are used to eating first thing after they got up. My hope is that since they are creatures of habit, if I can just be consistent that it will correct itself over time.

At this point, I am managing about 3 miles of walking/running in a day, which is enough to get my all three rings closed. I also have a rowing machine that is my backup, so that if it gets too hot out or the air quality goes down and makes it hard to breath, I have something to keep me active.

For anybody else who is thinking of getting back to exercising, here are my suggestions and considerations for you.

- Start your exercising earlier in the day, it makes it easier to reach your goals
- Set a realistic goal you can hit every day
- Involve others (friends/family/pets) in the activities to create a support system
- Come up with more than one activity
- Break up the routine throughout the day

For any of you looking to get started, just remember to stay active! Now I am off for my next mile walk.
