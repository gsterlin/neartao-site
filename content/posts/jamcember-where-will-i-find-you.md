Day... Seventeen

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/where-will-i-find-you

I just like this track... guess I have nothing else to say about it today :D

Update:

Okay... I was being lazy yesterday... cleaning up after the blizzard kind of got to me.

For this track I really decided to pair down the frantic energy and focus a bit more on natural sounding instruments with some air, space, and environment to them. As I said yesterday, I am quite happy about how it came out, though mixing was a bit of a pain due to how different the levels were on all of the tracks.

I also suspect that I could have gotten away with a bit more drums or something going on, but at the heart, this was intended as a 68bpm track, and I figured if I got too carried away it was going to feel like a 136bpm track, which in some ways it kind of feels that way in a few spots.

Hopefully you'll get to chill out with this track though, take it easy, and enjoy the atmosphere :D
