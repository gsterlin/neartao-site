The thirteen day is upon us, and it is good...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/faerie-dust

This is another track that I spent some time putting together four bar loops in Reason Studio 11 in order to get some content that I could chop up and mangle in the MPC.

There wasn't anything too special about the chops, but the bass line was played out a bit wonky to start, and I just kind of went with it. The first two bars are super simple, and then the last two bars get a lot more complex. From there, I built a lot of the melody and chords around it.

The drum sounds are perhaps a bit... subdued, and the glitched out overdriven noisy percussion might be too much. I tried to tame it, but also keep it sounding a bit raw.

I spent a bit more time thinking about how the sound space would work together, but didn't really take the time to EQ all of the parts enough to give them a fully separate sonic playing field. I think it came out fine, but the build up near the end with just about all of the parts playing together does have a few sections that are a bit harder to pick out some of the parts.
