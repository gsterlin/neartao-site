The second of two remaining tracks for the month!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/deeply-stricken

So this track has several key groups that I auto sampled off of both my Access Virus TI2 Darkstar and Waldorf Iridium. I figured I'd upload the patches for those interested or who are just looking for some synth sounds to play with... so you can get them below. I didn't bother trimming anything... so the file is a bit large... but go nuts and have fun!

This last track I spent a lot of time focussing on note progressions and playing things out myself, to see if I could get a bit more feel into the song. I will say that I am mildly happy with the results, but I am a little sad that the flute part I put in just did not fit the song structure I came up with. It was a bit too out there, and a little too much of a change. I suppose these kinds of little nuggets are the types of things you record off for future rainy day inspirations, but no time for that now! It is time to start thinking about the next track.

Nearing the end of the month of doing a track a day, I'm going to have to start thinking about what is next for me. I'm kind of digging the pressure to keep moving forward, but I am also thinking that there's a fair bit of tracks I'd like to go back to work on and see about making a proper album to publish. There are a few ideas that I am toying around with for next month so, we shall see which direction we go!
