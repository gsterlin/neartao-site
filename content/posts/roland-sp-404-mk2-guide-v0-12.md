This update was to try and fill in some information about the actual Data in the mk2.

[neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.12](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.12.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.12.pdf)

I spent some time trying to figure out the directory structure and format of different files. So far I haven't figured out much about the .bin files, or how the mk2 might be storing or managing much of the data. This will take some time to work through, and I have a few ideas for experiments.

Other than that, I tried to fix a few sections of information that needed updates, but they were mostly minor.

Thanks!
