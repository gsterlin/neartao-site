For the picture that's not real smoke/steam, but boy does it feel like there is something going on in my wrist.

Saw a nurse practitioner.

Pretty sure it's not CTS. I noticed a lump on my wrist now that the swelling is down a bit... and it is likely I've got a ganglion cyst near my palm attached to one of the tendons. I can feel it is a bit mushy on the tendon, and it moves when I move my fingers. It's quite possible that this additional mass is pushing on some of the veins, and it's likely also getting caught up on my other tendons when I move my hand.

There's a lot going on in that part of the body, and I'm not about to try and pop the cyst. I tried that years ago with the cyst on the back of my wrist on my left hand, and it was painful enough without all the nerves and stuff there. So no thanks.

Scheduling to get an Ultrasound for a better look of what is going on in there, and then to see an Orthopedic specialist starting next week. Hopefully this is something easy to fix, but it's probably going to take surgery. \*sigh\*
