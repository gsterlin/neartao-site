No eurorack modules were harmed in the making of this video. The PO-32 (Tonic) makes up the drums, the PO-35 (Voice) is how I got the "No More Technology" hook, and... the lead/bass came from some Eurorack mess. I recorded all of this into Ableton Live for some FX processing. All of this was recorded back in October/November, and I've meant to create a finished track.

In the spirit of #Jamuary though, I figured I'd break out some gear and refine the track a bit more. I'm really trying to cap myself to about 30-60 minutes of production time this month for each song. This is good in some ways because it's forcing me to get ideas down, but it is bad in a few other ways since I'm really not mixing/mastering anything. Leaving this track with a bit more of a tinny sound than I'd like, but hey it is what it is.

I used to be a master with Ableton Live back in the day, but I haven't touched it much lately. First, I have been kind of a hardware snob... so there's that. Second, most of my productions were done between Live 1.1 and Live 6.0. I've really fallen quite behind in a lot of features, so I'm going to have to learn the software again.
