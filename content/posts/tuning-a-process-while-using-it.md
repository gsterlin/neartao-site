title: Tuning a Process While Using It
url: /

---
Sometimes... sometimes you need to modify a process while you are in the middle of using. Actually most of my career this has been the case, you are either trying to bootstrap a process to put it in place to help streamline something that feels broken or you've got a long standing process and it something else has changed that makes you reassess your process.

In the past, I have likened this to trying to repair your care while you are driving down the road. It is no fun, and is terribly scary to do, but the worst thing is that it can lead to making things feel absolutely worse
