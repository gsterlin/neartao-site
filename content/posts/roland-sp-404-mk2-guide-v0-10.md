This is a pretty huge update, yikes!

[neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.10](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.10.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.10.pdf)

I got a bit obsessive over the last few days, and read just about every single post in the [Elektronauts' SP-404 mk2 thread](https://www.elektronauts.com/t/roland-sp-404-mk2/161021/3386) as well as the [Gearspace SP-404 mk2 thread](https://gearspace.com/board/electronic-music-instruments-and-electronic-music-production/1362254-roland-sp-404-mkii-37.html). This is well over 4000 posts to read through, and took me the better part of four or five days to complete. Lot's of good questions, and lots of good answers, but I'm not sure I am up for doing a repeat of that any time soon.

All of this reading has resulted in a lot of really good questions for the mk2 (around twelve pages worth), and I have as much as possible been adding in answers either from forum members or just doing my own research. I would have gotten this out last night, but I figured it was worth spending the time to better organize the questions.
