Based on some questions, I decided to put together a quick post on how to use a Midi USB adaptor with your iPad to control your Akai MPC. This should work on any Midi equipped device, but below is the video I created as a short walkthrough.

https://youtu.be/E19Dxo7N4uY

Equipment:

[Apple USB-C to USB Adaptor](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter) \- Honestly any USB-C to USB Adaptor should work here, but this is what I had on hand to get this to work.

[Roland USB MIDI Interface UM-ONE](https://www.roland.com/us/products/um-one/) \- I suspect many other USB to MIDI interfaces should work, anything that is compatible with the iPad should be fine, but this again is what I had on hand.

Have fun!
