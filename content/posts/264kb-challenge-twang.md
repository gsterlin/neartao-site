The second 264kb challenge track I put together and dropped over at [MPC Forums](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=210304), and a bit more focussed on an experimental sound.

The picture is of a cigar box style guitar my dad made for me for my birthday last year. It's mostly stayed in my closet, though once in a while I have taken it out. There's something a bit messed up with it though, and it honestly needs some TLC. I'm not quite sure what the problem is with it, so that's a bit of a problem for me to fix it. I'll probably need to bring it back to him and see if he can figure out what needs to be done to fix it. If I recall... the pickups are a bit wonky and not ping up one of the strings very well... though it could be something else. What does this have to do with the track? Nothing... just thought it was a kind of need picture.

Went for a bit more of an out there experimental track. Lot's of pitch shifting... reverb, and delay... plus other effects smattered in for good measure. I was initially going for more of an ambient bent, but was getting some really fun rhythms with some of the delays and just went for it. or anybody who wants to check out the project... it's honestly nothing terribly special... but if you're curious how I put it together check out down below. If I went back, I'd separate all of the different sounds into tracks and work out track mutes and such to make it sound better... and I think there's some judicious use of filtering tracks that could get some cool effects... but maybe next time.
