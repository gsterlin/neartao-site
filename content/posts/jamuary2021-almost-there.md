Day 16... it may be cold outside but it is getting warm in here...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/almost-there

The picture is a chocolate cake we had for Valentine's Day... really good... I'm pretty sure my wife picked it up at Whole Foods... if I remember correctly.

For the track it's another mix of chops and synths... and auto sampling... and mistakes. I spent a lot of time looking for sounds that I felt would work together, so this track feels pretty good. Normally I'd upload the auto sampled synth... but it has echo in it... making me have to record every single note for the group, and then this makes it hard to use outside of a 96bpm standpoint... as well... it also only works for the notes I sampled which... put it in the rather not so useful category for a general standpoint. I may try and find a good delay/reverb match to make it into a generic MPC patch... but for now it just felt kind of strange to upload something so rigid and honestly kind of single purpose.

Today was another round of uploading mistakes. I forgot to route all of the audio to Sub 1 when using the YAM suite... which made for lots of distortion... then I also forgot to spend some time tweaking the mix based on what the mastering was doing... so the bells were ear splitting. Honestly... I should just write down a bunch of workflow check boxes to make sure I am doing everything properly and in the right order. Sounds like something to do once I wrap up this month of daily tracks.
