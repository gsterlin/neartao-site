Last day for #jamuary2021... and I'm happy to look towards doing some more music still, but probably at a slower pace so that I can focus on tracks a bit more.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/quiet-heart

The picture is of the fire pit that we built... going to miss it when we move to the new house, but we'll create another one :D

The track came together pretty quickly while I was watching my daughter play the sims, make a character of me... who she promptly made broke, and then I guess I was then homeless. She had my avatar doing a lot of weird things. It makes me wonder what my daughter thinks of me sometimes.

As far as the track itself goes, I just pulled some various loops, chopped them up, and worked through some FX to make a few things have a deeper sound.
