Is it time to start the count down?

Well this one was a bit more of a pain to get started. I have had a mild headache most of the day and just didn't want to put any energy into making a track... however the show must go on!

The picture is courtesy of my basement... and the dead spider is courtesy of the glass apparently trapping it in. I don't exactly know what made me think of the picture or the title for the track, but somehow they are now linked in my brain waves.

For the music, I pushed myself to sample everything off of the iPad, so all of the sounds are courtesy of Korg Module and 909 Drums, then run through some euro rack modular effects and chase bliss guitar pedals to flavor the audio a bit. To make life easier I ended up making some key groups through the MPC autosampler, and made a drum kit, which I didn't use most of.
