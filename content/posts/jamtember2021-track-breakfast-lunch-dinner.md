I did some of the work yesterday for this track... just happened to have some extra time to kick it off. Then today... happened. A lot going on, but I really wanted to get some more going for the track by adding a few more sounds.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/breakfast-lunch-dinner

The picture is from Hawaii, and I had gotten my wife a coconut to drink. She loves it... I keep trying to drink coconut water, but frankly it is not for me. I'm sure it is healthy, but just not my thing. My wife can drink it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner though!

All the sounds were either recorded onto, or though the Boss SP 202. It's not a super functional device, but definitely imparts its own particular sonic quality onto the sound recorded. I also used the mic on the SP 202 to record in some silly beat boxing. Boy was that out of time. I recorded it into the Live in the looper, but had to chop it up in Sample Edit, and then I corrected the timing by exporting it to the track and then using timing correct to help it out.

The piano sound was something I played with the Electric synth on the MPC as chords, and then recorded the audio into the SP 202 with Lofi 2. I liked how the sound came out, but it did need some filtering to take down the high end a bit. Yes it was super dirty.

The choir came from Hype synth on the MPC, and I actually thought it worked pretty well.

All in all, I'd say the SP 202 is pretty good, though for how much they are going for these days I'm not sure I'd suggest somebody to pick one up. I have been having fun with it, and am intending to dig deeper, but we'll see how much I can get out of it that I cannot get out of the MPC
