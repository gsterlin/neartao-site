A drum kit I put together using a few scripts I threw together to try and help package all of this content up a bit neater so I can focus more on the samples and post content.  Right now I know I'm not writing anything terribly interesting, but I'm hoping the demo tracks I'm putting together show off the sample packs a bit.  I'll be considering documenting up the process to get the samples together, but then again, maybe it isn't terribly interesting.  We'll see.

The song I put together from the kit is at [https://soundcloud.com/neartao/high-trapeze](https://soundcloud.com/neartao/high-trapeze) and hopefully it helps you get a sense for the samples in this Sample Pack.
