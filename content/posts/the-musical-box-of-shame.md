I'm sure a lot of us have it. A box in the corner with some music gear, instruments, effects, or whatever, that we want to use but don't really use. For me, this box was holding an OP-1, OP-Z, Microgranny, Organelle, and plenty of other things. All really fun and cool gear, but I've tried to use them lately, and just wasn't getting much value or use out of them.

With a heavy heart, and feeling a bit guilty for putting money into this gear but not getting much use out of it, I decided it was time to put it up for sale for somebody else to hopefully use.

## Teenage Engineering OP-1

This was something I just wanted for so many years, but the price really is too much. However, I did do a lot of research on it, and at least had a very clear idea of what I would be getting into. I knew it was going to be obtuse, I knew that it didn't support multiple projects, and I also knew it had a lot of interesting restrictions that I felt would help push me into solving musical problems in an interesting way.

That said, about a year after having bought it, I dug the looper, and I found the instruments to be decent, but I just couldn't escape the toy feeling of how it worked, especially when comparing it to the MPC Live. Sure, this is not a fair comparison by any stretch of the imagination, but I have made the conscious decision to dig more into the workflow of the MPC Live, and the way the OP-1 works is at direct odds with how I have gotten myself to be more effective and productive. So last year I put the OP-1 up for sale, and then after a few days decided to take it down. I just liked the idea of it so much.

After taking it down, I'd use the OP-1 from time to time, especially for just doing some quick sampling or looping, and I have to say it continues to be a fun if restricted looper. I decided to take the OP-1 with me on a nine day vacation, mostly because of it's size, and I planned to make a track a day with it. Just something to really push myself to get into it or get out of it. Well, I did do a track a day with the OP-1, but I have to say I wasn't really excited by it any more. I just felt like it was a lot of fighting with it to get anything done, and the lack of undo features, as well as how easy it is to accidentally ruin a track by overdubbing content on top, I just decided it was time for it to go.

It might sound like I don't like the OP-1, and this is absolutely not the case, but I have come to the realization that it's just not adding much to my music production.

Things I will miss about the OP-1:

- Limited, but quick sampling
- Although mono, the looping abilities are a treat to work worth, 8 tracks would be so dreamy
- Odd but inspiring synths, the controls weren't always great, but you could stumble on interesting ideas
- Committing to tape, this has forced me to consider approaching material in a more direct and less structured "on the grid" way

## Teenage Engineering OP-Z

I've quite enjoined the OP-Z and just how immediate it is as well. While I never really found it expressive per se, it was definitely quick, and the sequencer, oh why could the sequencer not have made it in some form to the OP-1? The size of the OP-Z is amazing considering just how much it can do, and while there were plenty of complaints about case bending and knobs popping off, I never had problems with either and bought mine pretty early in the lifecycle.

That said, I just never came to love the OP-Z. The parameters for it were always kind of obtuse, and I didn't really memorize all the key combinations. Getting the skin for it was a big help, but it wasn't terribly fun for me to be constantly flipping it over to read another key combination to put it into some mode to program parameter locks, adjust track settings, or some other thing. Conceptually I really like the OP-Z, but in the long run I guess the implementation just didn't hold me.

So, I also took the OP-Z with me on the trip to Hawaii, just as a last ditch effort to try and do something, anything with it. I absolutely got my head wrapped around it more, but the entire time I was just wishing I had the MPC with me. Hard decision time, but I put the OP-Z up for sale as well.

Things I will miss about the OP-Z:

- I do dig the parameter lock concept, and while there are things that are similar on the MPC, the OP-Z can currently do a lot of randomization and other things that you just cannot get at right now on the MPC line.
- Size, if the OP-Z just had a bit more robust sampling time, better sampling, anything, I'd probably consider keeping it. I felt like it mostly struck a great balance between size and features, but probably borrowed a bit too much from the OP-1 constraints for my taste

## Bastl Instruments MicroGranny 2.5

It's an 8-bit granular sampler, what's not to like? I have to say, that it's a clever little device, and it can sound great. The built in microphone makes it another gem for a portable setup, and you can get a lot out of such a weird and wonderful package. Better still, it is battery powered so you can toss it in a bag and play it. The biggest bummer to me is that it is only one note of polyphony, but you can manipulate six different samples, and you can address it from a MIDI controller to do some really fun stuff.

Sadly, I think this just was in the "okay lets sell things off" rampage. I had a ton of fun using this, especially on some ambient tracks I did, you can hunt and peck for some very awesome sounds, but it's also kind of a long process to load in samples in the right format, audition them, and use the semitone knob to adjust pitches and restart the sample. While the interface is fairly straight forward, I think the operation was just let down a bit by the hardware implementation itself. Still fun, but I guess it was time to move on.

Things I will miss about the MicroGranny

- It's just at that weird end of the LoFi spectrum where you're not going to get clean samples no matter what you do, it grinds up and spits out whatever you send its way
- Again, another device that portability cannot be beat, and I didn't find that it ate 9v batteries too quickly. It struck me as a good balance for use of hardware

## Critter & Guitari Organelle M

This wacky device just struck me as the end all be all device. Super backpack friendly, mic, speaker, batteries, keyboard, and unlimited patches. Just something you can go anywhere and do music and have fun. This is 100% true, and I love the company's vision for this device. Then, add on Technobear's updates and everything, holy smokes this device is banging! You can literally make anything on it, and watch the videos Critter & Guitari put out, I mean how can you not love this thing?

Seriously, even though I sold it, I still love it for what it is. Where I made the decision to sell it off though was more about the interface and how it comes together. Similar to some other things on the list I think ultimately the inconsistent UI let's it down. There are just so many patches, and they all operate incredibly differently. The tiny display doesn't always do a great job of showing you what is going on inside the device, and while you can hook up an HDMI cable and look at the patches, that's not something I suspect most people will do, and I doubt most people are going to print out manuals for each every patch either. It's just overwhelming, and I guess the reality set in and I decided I have more focussed instruments to do the jobs I was interested in using the Organelle M for.

Things I will miss about the Organelle M:

- Just how programmable this thing is, it can literally become anything you can imagine and put your mind to
- The fun and wild patches that lead to interesting experimentation
- The patch community was awesome and really lead to some fun interactions

## Conclusion

I feel like once or twice a year I go through this kind of purging exercise, and then write about it, and I have no idea if it helps anybody else, but it does help me get a better understanding of what I want and what I am trying to do with music and gear in my life. I keep saying I don't want to become a museum, and I really am not. I don't need multiple devices doing the same thing, even if I do have overlap. This has also helped me figure out which kinds of things I have ordered that have been stuck due to "chip shortages"... stuff I probably just don't need so should get the money back.

The last few weeks I've also been spending more time getting focussed on a project with the MPC and a limited set of eurorack gear to put a set of tracks together. The box of shame wasn't exactly getting in the way, but it is also a set of gear that I no longer need to consider about maintaining, or feeling bad that it is just 'sitting around' and unused. I'll probably be extending this to some gear I am hesitant to get rid of, but I also am feeling more and more that it will be a good exercise for myself to be realistic about how much gear I really need and can realistically use and keep maintained.

Oddly, and I've kept thinking back on this set of gear in particular, I had picked it all up pre pandemic with the intent of going out and making music on hiking trips, business trips, I don't know... all kinds of trips. The reality has been, I've been mostly staying at home and have not taken many trips, and have as a result spent most of my time in my house, like just about everybody else. My vision just never really came into fruition, and I don't see this changing over the next year or two either. Given some of the latest updates for the MPC 2.10 firmware, I'm also seeing it come into it's own as an instrument, and while it has plenty of bugs, nothing has made me think that Akai won't keep improving the instrument and the platform. So, I think I could be moving into a world where I just get a decent case for the MPC and when I travel it can come along with me, and otherwise it will stay hooked up to the rest of my studio.

Overall I'm feeling quite good about moving on what I have moved on, and I look forward to the next few months seeing which direction I intend to go for myself and my gear.
