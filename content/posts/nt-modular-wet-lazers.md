Okay... queue up the kinda cheesy FX sounds... this is mostly just the Disting EX routed through Squawk Dirty To Me for filtering. Honestly it's not \*that\* special, but I did do a little bit of LFO routing into a VCA into the resonance CV control to get that slight vibration sound.

I did try briefly to see if it was quick to use velocity CV out from the MPC, but I didn't get it working with just a few knob twiddles, so frankly... I failed at it. Going to need a bit more reading of the manual again to see how to get it going.
