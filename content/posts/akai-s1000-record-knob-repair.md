I have been working on restoring an Akai S1000 that I picked up on eBay, and it has needed some help. To put it nicely the previous owner seems to have let it go, and maintenance was not on the forefront of their mind. Not a big problem per se, but the box it arrived in was a mess, and it was very poorly packed. I don't think that this S1000 had seen much love in a long time.

One of the problems that it has had since I picked up was a very, very, very, noisy rec gain knob, that when you turned it would make a lot of noise and static. This is a common problem on older gear, the material oxidizes and then there is not a consistent signal flow which causes this noisy sound when turning the knob.

There are a few ways to try and repair it. The first would be to do a complete replace of the potentiometer, but I wasn't up for taking the whole S1000 apart and doing all of the necessary soldering work. Instead I decided to take it apart just enough to spray some Deoxit into the back of the potentiometer.

Before getting started, I disconnected everything from power. I had to take off the face panel, it wasn't too hard but getting the angle right on the spray was a bit tricky. This wasn't too much work, but it required taking notes down as I pulled it apart so that I knew where parts came from and where they needed to go. As you can see, with the volume/gain knows, they are a bit further down in the chassis. This makes it a bit harder to get the Deoxit spray into the back of the potentiometer to deoxidize it.

Once you spray the Deoxit in there, you'll want to turn the knob back and forth for a while to help get the material in there to do the deoxidation magic. I'd say about 60 seconds is good and enough time to help let it dry, but definitely read the directions on your can to see what it says. Also... as with many things, a little bit will go a long way, so don't try and fill up that port with Deoxit.

Once you're satisfied, if you haven't taken too much apart, I would try and plug the device back in carefully and see how well it works before you put everything back together, because otherwise you might be needing to take it all apart again, to do the job a second time.
