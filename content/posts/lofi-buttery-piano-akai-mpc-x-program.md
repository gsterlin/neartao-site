Let me start by explaining the patch a bit, and how I got here...

Life started off on the Akai S950, using piano multi samples from G1 through C4, every sixth note... My goal was to get some of that S950 12-bit grit and artifacts, but still keep it relatively free of the crazy stretching artifacts you can get by just sampling a single note and stretching it across the entire keyboard. This way, it maintains a lot of the characteristics of a piano, instead of heading into the field of creating what sounds like a more synthetic instrument.

From here, I routed the audio output into my guitar pedal board. The output on the S950 was a bit hot coming out of the mix channel though, requiring me to get the output level down to about halfway so that I wasn't hearing any clipping or distortion on the output signal from the S950. A little bit of strategic EQ'ing helped to round out the sound through Brothers, I wanted to get a bit of that old school Casio sound, though I don't have one handy any more for reference, so I was going from memory what of "that sound" was.

Once I settled into how I wanted to EQ the audio, I routed it to the Generation Loss. You'll definitely hear the Flutter the most, but there is some Wow in the background as well. I also switched on the Noise, I really wanted it to sound like the piano was recorded from an old school tape that had been played quite a bit, and the tape player was about to fall apart. This definitely shines through in the samples recorded.

Everything was sampled in through the Autosampler on the MPC X, and here I recorded every note, as I didn't want the Wow or Flutter distortion to get further distorted through the sampling engine on the MPC. Although the noise exists in the samples, I decided to tame it a bit by adding a low pass filter into the program. It helps pass through that strained sound without the piano sounding so harsh. If you want to add the noise back in just go into program mode and modify KeyGround->All and open that filter up.

Anyway, feel free to play around with this program, I had fun sampling it, and may end up adding some variations as I play around with it. I'm not sure you can tune anything to it or with it, but it definitely has a vibe all its own.
