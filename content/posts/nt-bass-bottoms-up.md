Messing around with the bass side of things, and liked how this was sounding. I tried to sample the space that had the most interesting sound to it, and going into the high end it rather tails off around C3 to C4... so don't expect to use this as a lead by and stretch of the imagination.

I spent a bit of time adjusting the ADSR, it was on the edge of popping on the attack, and I adjusted the release so it doesn't just abruptly stop. These changes were made in the program, so you can undo them if you want to keep the character.
