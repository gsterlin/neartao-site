Just a somewhat simple lunch break track...

https://youtu.be/OvOWOcHukWI

This track was so many takes to get to this somewhat still janky state. At least fifteen, and the worst is that I hadn't setup the input/recorder properly to actually capture any takes. I had a good one or two in there, and then realized I was recording off of the microphone and not off of the Zoom H6 inputs. Doh!!!

I was also fighting with some CV outputs from the MPC to gates into the Pam's... because... and I'm rolling my eyes at myself, I had not recorded off the triggers at all. So it was constantly loosing sync, the resets were doing what I wanted, but well... I'm sure you can get the idea. I really need to create a template for my setup so that I don't have to keep remembering all this twiddly bits that can cause me a problem.
