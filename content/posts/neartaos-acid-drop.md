This Acid inspired pack took about 3 months to put together as something I wanted to end my 2023 Sample Advent Calendar project on.  I wanted to create a pack that had as much value in it as I could muster, and I wanted to give away as much for free to the community as I thought would make sense.

The paid version is available at [https://www.buymeacoffee.com/neartao](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/neartao) in the shop. What do you get for the paid version?  There's 353 samples, and 353 Synplant 2 patches, of which 193 samples are new for this pack, and all of the patches are available.  Yes that's right, if you've got Synplant 2, you can load up any of these patches and adjust the presets as you see fit.

The samples and patches break down to:

- 30 Bass Sounds
- 12 Clap Sounds
- 24 Hat Sounds
- 40 Kick Sounds
- 42 Lead Sounds
- 29 Misc Sounds
- 26 Pad Sounds
- 11 Rim Sounds
- 60 SFX Sounds
- 18 Snare Sounds
- 60 Synth Sounds
