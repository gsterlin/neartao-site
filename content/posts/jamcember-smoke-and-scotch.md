Rise and shine! Is it day eight already?

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/smoke-and-scotch

Well I am certainly embarrassed. Instead of going through "weeks old" tracks, I figured I'd dig deep and see what gems might be out there that are a year or more old... and I found this little number. Out of the box it was nearly ready to go, and for the life of me I could not tell you why I never got around to just putting a bow on it.

As apparently is usually the case, I had spent no mind thinking about song structure, and just went to town hitting pads out on a single track. It also took me some time to unwind the mess of auto sampled content I had sitting in here, and figure out what the heck was actually part of the track and what was just a gunking up the place.

So... after deleting unused programs and clearing tracks from the sequence, I took the time to carefully explode the content so I could take stock of what I really had for content. I will say, just playing out track mutes (minus the dang track mute start bug) was quite rewarding and I played around a bit just writing down ideas for different sections of the song, created the sections, and dumped it all into song mode.

From here, I listened to it a few times and thought some of the sections were just a little too similar from 4 bar to 4 bar... but I \*liked\* it... which was really important. I squirreled through a bunch of samples, pitching things around, and ended up adding that kind of glitchy sample that kicks off the intro and warbles in a kind of weird way. That helped, but it felt like it still needed some atmosphere. This is where I ended up digging out a forest Foley sample and layering it on top... and I have to say I really like the overall effect, it gives some nice unexpected movement to the track that otherwise wouldn't be there.

To finish the track and put a bow on it... I ran it through the YA Mastering 2.0.1, and I think I'm happy to say I'm finished with the track. Tada!
