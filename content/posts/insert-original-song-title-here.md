This is just messing around with the Akai MPC X, I tapped out a beat using the Rawcutz sample pack, and for those that care the sound kit is "HipHop-Kit-RC Ace Kit 95.xmp". Yeah yeah... I usually do my own chopping and sampling... but I was more interested in just putting something together quick and checking out how hot the output levels are on the MPC X, and how badly distorted it would get going through the Chase Bliss pedals.

{{< youtube zxwcdVdFI5g >}}

For one... the level and impedance are a bit too much for the pedals, unless you want a distorted and over driven sound. You don't have direct control with a knob for the outputs 3-8, so you'll either need a mixer, or in my case, I just dropped the output by -20db. This seemed like the right amount. This also means that to get back from guitar pedal level, back to line level, you'll need to bring the signal in a bit hot again. You can absolutely create clipping/over drive problems doing this, and it might be on output or on input issue, but you'll just have to trust your ear... or get fancy out board gear to measure your signals.

This isn't anything terribly fancy, I was just having fun blasting the sounds through the pedals and seeing what came out. I'm pleasantly surprised that the Spectre did not go into immediate whale calls, because that's a frequent side effect of this pedal. For this play through, I was less excited by the Brothers pedal, to my ears it just made the signal too hot. I'll have to experiment with pedal ordering some more, and it's possible Condor would help a bit with sound sculpting in this case.

Back to jamming!
