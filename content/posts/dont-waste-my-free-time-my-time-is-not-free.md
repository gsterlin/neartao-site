title: Don't Waste My Free Time, My Time is Not Free

Long time folks, I've mostly moved to YouTube and Patreon... but \*sometimes\* I do remember this small corner of the internet. I swear I need to get some tools in place to help me manage all of the stuff I am putting together... but that requires \*more time\*...

I'd rather spend my time actually responding to valuable questions and helping people out than writing a rant like this, but... here we are...

Those of you who know me understand that I really don't care to waste my time. When I make time to do something I try and put my full energy and effort into it. If something or someone seems to be wasting time, I'll do my best to address it, to make sure it is no longer a problem, and from there I'll do my best to ignore it. Consider this another attempt to address it.

In life though, there's always going to be those things trying to waste your time. I won't bore you with a list of things... just know that some people's behavior is very good at it, and they probably don't even recognize it in themselves.

I recently received a comment on YouTube of the "not valuable" sort. It said

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/screenshot-2025-08-05-at-7.00.50-am-1.png?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

To give full context, the individual in question had asked a rather uninformed/basic question about some music hardware, and I do strive to respond to people in general as I have time and as I see fit. I do try and answer top level comments in due time, but I don't always have free time to reply to everybody, and the more popular my channel becomes, the harder it is to respond to everybody. To make it more complex, any top level comments are easy for me to find through Google's tools, but the deeper a thread goes, the more I wish people would start a conversation on my Discord server because YouTube does not have the tools to manage comment threads.

I don't have exact statistics, but I believe my general response time is around one to two weeks. This varies based on my free time, how long it takes me to setup videos, do research, how busy my work schedule is, events or priorities with my family, what I have planned for the weekend, and a multitude of other factors in my life.

I'm conflicted about what to do with something like this. I don't want to flame the person in question, but I do want to highlight the general attitude that some people have, because this is a pretty deeply coded message, even if the intent was not there. It's also super easy to read too much into this as plain text obviously doesn't have all the nuances of in person human language, and leaves it up to the reader to extrapolate from there.

Let's hit the bullet points though

- Odd level of insecurity about their previous message
- There is a level of passive aggressiveness here, no threats, but still feels like a form of bullying
- In this message there is a level of entitlement as if I owe the person a response, while I may do this, I owe this person nothing
- Finally this is a ham fisted demand for me to reprioritize my time, that I do give for free, to them.

Overall, I personally find this to be a rather immature way to seek attention. It is a lazy attempt to get me to reprioritize my effort, and it offers nothing in return. I would suggest a much better approach would have been something along the lines of "it would mean a lot to me if you could respond to my other message" or even offering me something (not even money) for my time.

_Why offer something when I am "giving it away for free"? Why I'm so glad you asked dear reader. I typically pick up the most interesting things "to me"_ _to talk about or discuss. Or, if I already have something setup for a video shoot, and just need a few adjustments, I'll move onto something that is easy "for me" to record. You might notice a bit of a theme here, but it is about "me"._

There's a layer of "hey jerk pay attention to me" as well, that I just find distasteful. I get that the person is irritated or upset that I haven't responded to them yet, but on the flip side I owe this person nothing. I am not about providing instant gratification to people in general, and I am not providing any kind of "paid for" service that would give anybody some kind of expectation that I even should respond. There's a kind of bullying behavior here

_You might ask yourself "What am I supposed to do with this?" If I respond to the original message, I am just setting a poor precedent that the best way to get my attention is to keep pestering me until I respond, which just further wastes my time. I don't want this behavior, and frankly, I would rather take the time to just delete these kinds of messages if they become a nuisance._

So... spending some of my free time making YouTube videos to help teach people about music does have the side effect of receiving unwanted attention. It is par for the course. The more public you make your life, the more people feel they have something you owe them, or perhaps that they know you well enough that they can ask for anything. This just leads to both positive, negative, and everything in between for comments.

I give nearly all of the music related content I make away for free, this is because I see the value for others in giving more to the community than I expect in return. As an odd side effect, the more I give away for free, the more people think they can be pushy to get what they want out of me. I know the value of my time though, and I know it is definitely not zero. To put it a different way, I choose to educate where I can for free because I enjoy helping people out, and I know in general most people could not afford my time.

I have had a very small group of people ask how much it would cost for me to give them personal lessons. Out of this already small group, very few people have actually had the funds to afford sessions with me. As much as possible I have offered to make public material for them to see if I can help them (and others) for free as much as possible.

I may provide this service for free, and I may prioritize certain aspects of it within my life, but there are very very few people in this sphere of my life that I would reshuffle my day around for in their interest. There are some, and they know who they are... but random people on the internet?

At the end of the day, my time is my time. How I choose to use my free time, unless we've worked a deal out, is fully up to me.
