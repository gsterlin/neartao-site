I've got a relatively small backlog of programs to upload, but it is a backlog none the less. As I said in the previous post, one of my dogs got super sick, and I haven't gotten in the habit of having a lot of posts on standby to cover me when I get busy. Also, I've played with putting a few Youtube posts together, but I do not really have the proper camera, lighting, and other recording equipment at this time.

Anyways... this is a program I put together with an initially analogue sound that I drove to as pure of a sound as possible, and then smothered it in FX to make the low end dirty and a bit dark, though while you work up the scale it turns into a bit of a more open and perhaps friendlier, somewhat screaming, sound. Can you have a friendly scream? I'm not sure, maybe somebody out in the internet can help decide.

Onboard here are sound effects from the Chase Bliss Wombtone MkII for some moderate phasing effects, Chase Bliss Warped Vinyl providing a bit of vibrato, and polishing it off with a Chase Bliss Generation Loss to add a touch of Wow and a healthy dose of Bit Crushing.

The low end notes have some interesting bass characteristics, and if you let them play out they have an good amount of a throaty growl. As usual, give the program a spin, and even if you don't have an MPC X/Live, you can certainly convert the samples from 44.1k/24bit to whatever suits your sampler of choice. Have fun!
