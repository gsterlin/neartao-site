It's day five already... and I pulled together another track.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/from-left-field

The painting is a water color that I did years ago... probably over fifteen years ago. I happened to find it while going through my old notebooks looking for some blank paper. It's not that great, and I'll be using the other side to do some paintings for a project I am working on with my sister. So long sort of interesting tree and wild... what is that... a sunset?

The track itself is something that my notes tell me I kicked off a little over a month ago. Honestly, I've toyed with trying to complete it as a track a handful of times, and really wasn't happy with how it was coming out. Given the month of pushing through completing tracks though it felt like something that I could get behind. I liked it just enough, and it required quite a bit of work... so why not?!

Where I think this track falls down a bit for me and why it is a bit disjointed is because not all the bits quite fit together. I probably could have re-recorded some of the track sections to get a different vibe, but I kind of dig the vibe, and perhaps its just the tone(s) that needed some tuning to sit better with each other.

One thing that was painfully obvious once I really started tracking out was I had done a really poor job chopping. Lazy chopping definitely made me lazy here, and really contributed to some of the initial poor sound. Tails on chops would spike, or lead into the next sound, and while it wasn't noticeable in the main and chorus type sections, it was painfully obvious how bad they were in the drops, intros, and outros. Sticking to the laziness, I was going to just post the track as is without fixing it, but as soon as I ran it through a YA Mastering round... well \*oof\* it was so much worse. The compression really grabbed onto those transients and made them so painful to hear that I had to fix it before releasing the track.

I'll wrap up today by saying yeah... it's fine to be lazy and all, especially when you're trying to hammer through tracks one or more a day, but I suppose don't let your laziness get the best of you to produce a really poor product. There's a difference between being efficiently lazy, and just disgustingly lazy. While I'm not stoked with how this track came out... I at least pushed it away from the disgustingly lazy more than it had been.
