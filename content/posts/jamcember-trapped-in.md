This is the 10th track...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/trapped-in

I was digging through some more old tracks I had put together, and wanted to wrap this up. I sampled off the piano through CBA Generation Loss a year ago, and just really dug the sound of it. When I stumbled upon the track I just kept thinking, you know... I need to make something of this..

Honestly though, I am not really happy with how it all came together. I think I tried too hard, and it's kind of hot garbage. I definitely spent too much time working on it and just not feeling the vibe I had been hoping to go for, and ultimately it just didn't really come together into something that I can smile at. Even just going back and listening to it again I have to give it a thumbs down. Not my best work, but we've all got to start somewhere.

While this track feels kind of like a dumpster, I do think there is something here to come back to and try and resuscitate into a better track. A lot of the skeleton is there, but it probably takes quite a bit more thought about what I want to do. Stay tuned I guess?
