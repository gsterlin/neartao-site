This was initially just testing out my reconfigured setup... but figured I'd run with it.

This doesn't mean I'm abandoning the configuration I am working on for getting multiple tracks together, just that I was getting some more concepts together :D Nothing technically I haven't done before, but this is all tracks that I played out, tweaked notes, velocity and all that fun stuff, to try and get a sound I was going for. Hopefully the levels are working better...
