Here's an updated version of the guide. At this point, it is mostly changes coming in from people asking questions on my YouTube videos, and my curiosity to dig in and see if I can find suitable answers, solutions, or in some cases workflows. So the update is again an accumulation of a lot of minor tweaks and things I have learned about the SP404 mk2 from people asking questions that I didn't know the answer to.

I tried to clean it up a lot by removing ??? and putting comments where I might make changes so that they aren't rendered out in the text on the pdf side. I also went through and removed a lot of sections I had stubbed out as I'm not sure I will ever get to them in this book anyways.

Anyways, hope everybody is having a happy holiday season!
