Another day and not as much time to dedicate to the track as I'd like... still mostly happy with how it came out though.

https://youtu.be/24Y1qDwL7X4

More of a laid back/chill track for today. With of course, buffers galore, glitch effects, etc... this required over a dozen practice runs because I was trying to get a bit more movement and hands on with the track, but was causing some incredibly disorienting pitch shifts and swells. The practice helped a lot though, and I think I ended up making a lot less mistakes in this track than some of the previous ones I've done.

Definitely time to start thinking on what to do with these tracks and looking into how to make a proper set. I'll wrap up beatober in another week, so closing in on the time to figure out what to put together with the added time
