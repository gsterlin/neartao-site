Still sucks hitting the pads, but I'm trying to take a bit more mind of hitting the pads. I want to finish off the month and not have too much "junk".

I probably spent more time than I should have, and it didn't help my right wrist much, but I'm really trying to figure out where the pain is, and if it is more from typing, sitting at a desk, hitting stuff, or what. I'm not sure if I have CTS or something, but the palm of my hand is sore, and I didn't mention before but my right index finger is now cold. That started about a week ago, the coldness, and I didn't think anything about it.

Off to stretching my wrists more to see if it helps, it hurts a lot, but I'm hoping it's just a circulation issue that I can fix. Gonna call the Dr though to see what in the world is going on.
