So… like a lunatic, I just wrapped up two months in a row of making and publishing a track a day.  If you're interested in what I did last month, go check out the [#jamcember2020](/2020/12/31/reflection-on-jamcember-2020-challenge/) post. My goal was to publish a track to soundcloud, that no matter how good or bad, I was putting something up.  Trust me, there are some stinkers up there, but I also managed to put some content up that I think sounds great and stands on its own pretty well!

I wrote up a blog post for each day, but I feel like now that a week has passed, it's worth taking some time to reflect on what's different for me having made a track a day (actually more due to a few Beat Battles and other Challenges), and where I feel like I am now musically.

What has changed about me and my music production?

I will tell you without a doubt, that pouring my time into a single piece of hardware, I feel like I know it so much better now. Sure there are many things I can still learn, but I am much closer to a comfort level with the MPC than I was before. When I started this, all I could think about was "boy I cannot wait for this to be over so I can get back to all the effects and instruments in my DAW", and now I'm not so sure that is always the right answer. There's a certain freedom from knowing your gear whether it is hardware or software better, and it helps reduce the impulse to go someplace else. For me this has helped me be more productive as a result, I am not struggling to reach for something comfortable, and its put me back into the mindset of thinking through my options to get around a problem and find a solution.

I had become so used to Ableton Live as well, and doing micro edits and tweaks, and working in the MPC I do know you can dig under the covers there as well and get into the minutia... but I'm also wondering if it really is worth the effort all the time to get everything to an exacting level of perfection. When you're publishing a track a day, you really don't have the luxury to tweak everything to be perfect, and there is a certain charm to leaving some rough edges. As an artist, it is always important to think about what mistakes are valuable and which ones you need to fix... and I guess I was leaning into the mindset of driving towards perfection when working in the DAW. Again... you can get to this level with the MPC as well for sure, but I didn't afford myself the time for this, and I think it has rubbed off on my mentality.

How has producing a track a day changed my process?

I mentioned this last month, but I'll dig a little deeper. From the perspective of putting something out there regardless of how good or bad it is, it is a good process. It is important to remember what we may think is bad, somebody else may appreciate it. Assuming you are making art for yourself, what is the big deal anyways? Many of the tracks I have posted have single digit plays. Do I care how many plays I got? Nope! So right off the bat, just committing to getting something out gets you into the thinking of the life of the track, not just the fruition. You've got to consider how the parts join together, where do you put transitions, and most importantly what are you trying to accomplish for the day?

So over the last two months, I've definitely developed some tools and strategies to make quicker decisions. I am not going to spend forever looking for the perfect sample, and I'm not going to spend time to take a bad chop and work it into something that is decent. Either way can consume a lot of time, and building the muscles to know when it is time to move on is really important. I now have a much better idea of how much time spent coaxing something or trying to force something to work is good, and how much is bad.

Another thing to point out is that I am now \*much\* more happy to build up a bunch of parts of a song, and then just let the things that ultimately don't fit in go to the way side and not get used. Previously I'd try and make everything I did count, and if I didn't use something cool I'd try and move it to a place to get back to 'later'. Guess what, those 'later' moments rarely come, and when you do have the time, you now have a potential wasteland of half thoughts and ideas to sort through to try and find gold. Honestly, it's not worth keeping mediocre ideas around for posterity, they just get in the way. Now to be clear, I am not saying toss all that stuff, but make sure you're saving off gold for the future, and not just making yourself sift through rubbish.

Would I do another track a day challenge for a month?

Oh absolutely! There were stressful times for sure, especially when my life and the challenge collided head on. I had evenings where I didn't have the time to concentrate, or was distracted by something else. The key here is that I \*wanted\* to do this, so there are a few tracks I posted that were the barest bones of stems, but I did something, which was the critical part for me.

I mentioned last month that I had frequently done prep work the night before to keep driving myself, and while I think it is a good option to consider, for this month, I didn't do that as many times. Maybe two times this month versus about fifteen or twenty times last month. Did it save me? Possibly, but on the other hand I'll be honest, looking back now, it's invigorating to have something you're interested in carrying forward, but it's a drag to be short on time, and then have to work on something you're not all that excited for.

At the end of the day, it just made it that much more clear to focus on the things that you are passionate about. There's nothing worse than getting to a project and having to slog through it. So... my advice if you want to try a track a day challenge is to make the time when you're into a track, and when you get a track that's kind of meh... just be cool with yourself to post something you know is kind of garbage. Accept it for what it is and move on, because not every day is going to be a winner. If it is, well you're probably cheating yourself and not taking risks to learn new skills.
