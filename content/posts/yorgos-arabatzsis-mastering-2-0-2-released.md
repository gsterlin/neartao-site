title: Yorgos Arabatzsis Mastering 2.0.2 Released
url: /2021/08/27/yorgos-arabatzsis-mastering-2-0-2-released/

Yorgos just released the 2.0.2 mastering suite for the Akai MPC Live/X/One using some of the new features in the 2.10 firmware. If you already have the suite you should have gotten an email, and he also posted some information on the MPC Forums thread [YA MASTERING TEMPLATE](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=189006).

Below is what I just posted in the [thread](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=189006&start=180), but adding here for posterity.

Here's a track with and without using the YA Mastering Template 2.0.2. Anything that sounds bad here is frankly on me for not taking a bit more time to adjust and get the sonics under control.

## Original Track

This is the original track, I mixed drums and bass to -9db and everything else from there, no end of chain effects or anything… it is pretty dry.

## Mastered Track

The same track, I tried the same mixing as above, as well as to -15db (in case it was toasty due to level issues, spoiler it was not), and the mastering chain happened to be accentuating some high end noise… so to get it under control I did some quick filtering as well on each track (LPF around 2k to 8k per track)

## Thoughts

For this particular track and how noisy the samples were (all samples run through an SP 303 and picked up some distortion/dirt) that I used, I actually expected the mastering chain to require more work than I usually need to put in, and if you listen to the drums they are still a bit toasty. This is for me to fix, not the mastering chain to manage. I am impressed at how well the mastering chain pulls some of the more subtle sounds out, bringing them to the foreground, and it does continue to do a great job in my mind for rounding out the sound.

Applying the 2.0.2 mastering is just as easy (or difficult depending on your viewpoint) as it was in the past, and I'll probably do some A/B comparisons between the 2.0.1 (which I have to say is A+ already) and 2.0.2 to see if I prefer one over the other. The only difference I really noticed so far was that the limiter seems to be holding the track from mastering to 0db, and instead is targeting -3db. Whether you like this or not is probably up to you… but I guess the only thing I'd note is that as a user you can obviously adjust this in the master fx chain to your personal taste… and it means that the YAM track is not quite as loud as it could possibly be.

Anybody who's interested in putting in the time (even if it is just 15-30 minutes) to improve their mix and take another step towards finishing their sound should definitely check this out.
