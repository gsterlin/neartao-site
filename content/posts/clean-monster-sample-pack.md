This Sample Pack was first published to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/neartao). Head over there if you'd like to learn about getting early access to the Sample Packs I am putting together.

This Sample Pack is intended as a drum kit that I put together as my first pass at making a BY-SA licensed Sample Pack. Â Definitely going to need to make some tools to simplify the process, but I'll need to see how it works out after doing the next three sample packs for the month before I get too ahead of myself.

I put a song together with the Clean Monster kit on my MPC Live and using some additional effects that you can check out at [https://soundcloud.com/neartao/creating-a-monster](https://soundcloud.com/neartao/creating-a-monster) to get a sense of the sounds.
