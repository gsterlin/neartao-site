This track was fun, but I also had a lot more time today to be picky with sound selection, make some various sections, and then add in eurorack for some extra spice.

This track started from the much cleaner track recorded on soundcloud that I did pretty much everything on the MPC, and then just ran it through and end chain of SP-202 and SP-303. I actually made a few other tracks that didn't make the cut because they just clashed a bit too much with everything going on here.

From here, I did a lot of takes routing the track through eurorack to get some serious effects going on as well as a bit of generative automation. More or less the instruments go through the top half of the rack and the drums and bass go through the bottom half of the rack. Then, everything back out to the SP-202 and SP-303 for a bit more grit added. Blog:
