Scurried off and used loop mode to record me noodling around on the Triton Studio until I found something that felt decent. I ended up unplugging a bunch of patch cables because there was some CV in place that was messing with me, so ended up with about 10 different but similar recordings, but had a lot of accidental drops and other problems. Was trying to hit something a bit more fun and wacky for today... and I guess I got there

If you watch the video, you'll see I didn't even unmute half of the tracks, this is because I had a bunch of midi tracks with data off to the Triton Studio, but I recorded loops and then added them to drum programs to trigger them. Super duper low effort, and probably not as clever as I could have gotten, but I was just trying to move along. I wanted to use the midi tracks just so I could work my way through a few voices to see what might work, and in the process found that some of the knobs on my Triton are stiff as heck... probably need some Deoxit to clean them up, but I'm not about to dig in there at this time. A task for another day for sure.
