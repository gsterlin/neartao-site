Day 23... just a handful more to put together to wrap up the month!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/foundation

The picture is from a trip to Puerto Rico... probably around twenty years ago now. Just a quick snap that I took while driving by the beach. The water down there is amazing!

Putting the track together, I figured I'd work on something a bit more experimental, so not quite so traditional drums and sounds, and just see how it came together. Overall, I am relatively happy with it, but the mixing seems off. I spent some time trying to adjust the levels, but I think there's some EQ and filtering that would need to be done to really make the track pop. I did my best by ear, but I got stuck in a few areas where having some visuals to go with the EQ to see where harmonics are probably would have helped be a bit more precise, instead of just using a low pass and high pass filter to just remove sounds completely.

Overall, I am still having fun, and this journey through the month has been a lot less stressful, and I attribute a lot of that to just getting much more intimately familiar with how the MPC Live works. While I don't know everything under the hood, there's quite a bit that I don't have to hit the manual for or experiment a few times to see what may or may not happen.
