Took my family to Boston, left the dogs home. Came back to the dogs having eaten up my notebook. Like WTF... we were an hour late from your usual feeding time, was it necessary to eat up my Hobonichi? Fortunately they didn't eat up any important notes, but I'm not sure Tomo River paper is good for their digestive system.

At any rate... it's the end of the month, not really sure what this track is, but it's in the \*shrug\* whatever... it is the end of the month, and I ran out of time for the day to really pull something together. Guess I need to live with my failure.
