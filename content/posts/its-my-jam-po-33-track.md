The image is courtesy of a road trip I did with my family from the East Coast out to Montana. On the way back we stopped at an amethyst mine, and I got some really cool pictures of some older beat up vehicles. There was some really cool stuff going on here, and we got some neat amethyst crystals to bring back home with us.

As for the song, nothing too fancy here, just using samples of thumps and bumps from everyday objects. A lot of the magic is just pitching things up and down, using filters... and then just jamming it out. I'm going to stick with the PO-33 a bit longer, but a lot of the initial magic playing around with the FX again is a bit gone, it has now gone from being novel to producing some pretty similar sounds to my ear. The device is still fantastic, and it might just be time for me start considering what I am going to move on to for a device to keep going on making tracks.

This is also another track I struggled with sounding like two different songs from the two four bar patterns I created. To remedy this I tried to create a couple two bar transitional sections to get it a bit more under control. I'm pretty happy with the results, and decided to take it for a spin through the Chase Bliss Audio effect monster. I'm pretty happy with it, but I think it's time for me to play around with the ordering of the pedals soon. They weren't put into any particular order other than what I thought might be interesting a couple of months ago.

I don't think I have hit the end of creativity with this little device by any means, and I've definitely spit out more content in the last week than I have in the last few months, but it is also what it is. Maybe I'll try and knock out another six to ten tracks, and actually write up more thoughts on it. Where I am is perhaps just a six or seven day slump. Too much creative energy expended?
