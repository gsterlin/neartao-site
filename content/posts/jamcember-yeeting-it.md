Sixteen days feels like more time making a track a day than it really is :D

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/yeeting-it

The picture comes courtesy of my wife's hand while we were visiting in Bangalore last year and she asked to get some Henna artwork done on her hand. Had a great time out there and would love to go back. The food was incredible!

As for the track, probably approaching the last days during this month of pulling content off of Reason Studio daily and then chopping up loops for inspiration, so I'll be looking around for another sound source or two for the month just to push myself in other directions. I've been itching to do some sound recording, and who knows, maybe I go industrial?

Enough about what may be though, this track was something where I clearly drove for a much more synth sound, and it feels like the basis for a pretty solid Electro House track. The drums came out alright after goofing around with effects, and I suspect I could have really pushed them harder to get a bit more of a booming sound. The synth, bass, and lead parts were my messing around a bit and trying to see what sounds worked well out of some Rob Papen rack extensions... and boy are some of those sounds cutting!

Overall I'm pretty happy with how the track came out, even if I'd have liked a bit more time with it. The repetition that was hurting me in some of the previous tracks works pretty well here, and this gives me some thoughts about going back and making five to six minute tracks again. Lately I have really been pushing to keep it down to a couple of minutes just to break some old habits, and mostly I've appreciated it, but here, for this track I suspect that a lot more could have been done.

As I keep saying though, there's always next time!
