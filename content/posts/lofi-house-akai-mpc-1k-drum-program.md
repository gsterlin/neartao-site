title: LoFi House - Akai MPC 1k Drum Program

Today I decided to play around with Reason again, and ended up recording the [LoFi House MPC 1k Program](/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lofi-house-mpc-1k-program.zip). Really nothing too fancy, but other than routing drums through a 12-bit distortion Rack Extension, with a bunch of tweaking to filter it a bit. Honestly, each drum hit could be better tweaked for a tighter sound, but I ran out of sampling steam. Perhaps I'll come back to a round two (or three) of these samples and trying and put something together a bit more consistent. So nothing too epic, but I figured it would be fun to play around with.

I almost posted the recorded audio that I chopped into the program, but honestly, the chops are more interesting. Instead I decided to throw together a demo loop of the Program. I put together this [LoFi Loop](/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/lofi-loop.wav) which is just a 96bpm loop with 66% swing. Nothing that knocks, and could definitley use some eq, but hey, it's free for you to do what you want with.
