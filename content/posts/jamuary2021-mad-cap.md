Day three's track is in the house!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mad-cap

The image comes courtesy of one of my wife's trips to New York City with her friends years ago. I repurposed it for my track... hopefully she doesn't mind :D

I mentioned yesterday that I started working on this track yesterday right after throwing in the towel for day two, and I really dig how this track came out. I decided to keep the flow super short, so it is just a Main section, Drop section, and Outro section... so absolutely nothing fancy, but I don't feel like it needed much else.

Once I played out the track in song mode (Main 3, Drop 1, Main 3, Outro)... I exported the song back to a sequence, and recorded in a tiny bit of CC automation on the Access Virus bass line in order to give it a bit of mod wheel and pitch bend. I maybe got a little carried away, but wanted to have something to add some subtle movement and surprise in the track.

To put the track together I also needed to record off a few parts as key groups, so if you're interested here's a couple of key groups for your music production pleasure.
