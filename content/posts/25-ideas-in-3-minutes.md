title: 25 Ideas in 3 Minutes

When I feel like I am stuck for ideas, one thing I like to do is rapid brainstorms. This is especially helpful for me because there is a tendency to get pushed into a specific train of thought, and sometimes I just want to move outside of the box that I have put myself in. In order to push myself I find it helpful to come up with as many random ideas to address a topic as I can within a short period of time. The idea is not to get 25 great ideas, but instead to explore thoughts that you might have otherwise ignored.

For this exercise, you'll need a topic, something to take notes on, and something to time yourself. Personally, I like to use my phone to set a timer, and a piece of paper and a pen or pencil to jot down notes and pictures rapid fire. At 25 ideas in 3 minutes, you'll need to be writing something down every 7.2 seconds to be able to keep pace, so let odd ideas build off of each other, and don't be afraid to throw in completely unrelated thoughts.

For example, I was struggling with my team handling things quickly or with a sense of urgency. Here's what a 3 minute brainstorming session looked like for me

Brainstorm 25 things to add team urgency:

- Happy/Sad Face for metrics
- Impact bonus based on urgency results
- Incoming reduction in headcount
- Stop allowing remote workers
- No group outings allowed
- Increase frequency of all hands meetings
- Start daily scrums
- Forced work hours
- Dress code imposed
- Team hats / slogans contest
- Pins / Badges provided for achievements
- Wood burning art for outstanding achievement
- In person award ceremony
- Free Time Off / Comp Time
- Command Keen (?) / Dopefish
- Commander Chaos (Assigned)
- Zombies!!!
- 360 Team Review
- No Conference attendance allowed
- Notepad to voice next all hands topics
- Announce fiscal year team goals
- Wear Signs / Boards
- Motivational Posters
- Random Assignment of Tickets
- Become the backup week

Ultimately the important part that came of this was just trying out new ideas and bringing to light frustrations that I really didn't realize that I had. Looking back on this list, some of these things don't even make sense, some could kill team morale, some things are draconian, and a number of things were just too costly or time consuming to implement. Yet, there are some interesting solutions that I did end up rolling out and implementing within the team because I needed to do something different.

If you've got something you're trying to work out, set yourself some constraints, limit your time, and put the random part of your brain to work and see what you can come up with!
