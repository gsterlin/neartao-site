Here's day 30... not much of a track... but maybe it'll grow up some day to be something bigger.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/just-be

Just a picture of little Zoe... waiting expectantly to get in the car for a car ride. She's a good girl and deserves as many rides in the car as she can get. Maria Gasolina is her nickname... she loves to burn that gas :D

I dunno... not much to say about the track today. I was trying to get a hip hop/pop (hip pop?) style track going... and I feel like this is where the track a day is an impediment... I just need more time to work through it, but I ended up spending about half the day with my parents... hadn't seen them since before December... and they only live about 40 or 50 minutes away. Just been a crazy time.

At any rate... I just took what I had and tried to make \*something\*... but I'm not really happy with it because for starters... I wanted to drop some vocals in there... but I've packed up my mic... and I feel like I just need to give it the time it deserves. So... I guess posting this feels lame, but I am literally at the end of the month for #jamuary2021 and today I just feel like crossing the finish line... and then pack more music gear up...
