Another mystery sample and program here. It is now nearly a month old, and I cannot remember what the heck I did at \*all\* for this one. I suppose the dog excuse is still valid and in play, but woof... "the dog ate my homework" never worked in school, and I suppose it doesn't really do much here.

What are my notes this wondrous day? Well check it out below.

Yeah, no help... I'm not even sure at this point that this sounds terribly "bassy" to me, it could be a functional lead as well... hmmm.

Well, take it away internet. I'll be here.
