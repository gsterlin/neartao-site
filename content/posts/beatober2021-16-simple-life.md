Decided to keep it simple today... really simple.

https://youtu.be/3bMvOTQSWq8

What all is going on? The picture comes from Neural Blender again... still having fun with this, I still need to buy some credits and go to town here. Even if the images are not necessarily directly useful, it's definitely got some inspiring and striking looks to a lot of it.

Well... the spacey ambient sound was some piano riffs I loaded up into the Morphagene, which was a pain because the piano audio was quite dynamic for its' range, going from really quiet -20db/-30db area to 0db. Sending it from the 3/4 outputs on the MPC (which I am sure are outputting at either 0db or possibly +4db, need to read the manual again) meant that until I dropped the track down to -9db it was just getting somewhat pleasing, but mostly awful noise on the high end. Certainly I could have used a LPF to clean it up, but honestly I wanted a cleaner sound here. Once I had the audio recorded, I then manipulated the gene size until I had something that seemed relatively musical and seemed like a nice enough progression. I then clocked the Morphagene from Pamela's New Workout so that it would play relatively at a speed with the track. From here I used the Mimetic Digitalis to change the cutoff on the Sqwak Dirty LPF to have the sound change over time while the track played.

The drums are another component that I just programmed, and then did the usual output from the MPC 5/6 into the Eurorack and sent it through the Sqwak Dirty for the LPF, which I sync'd the cutoff to the Total Recall which was running at a different clock speed than what was being used on the Morphagene. Honestly, this just allowed for a longer running pattern so that even though it was all running, the filter cutoff was changing different between the ambient pattern and the drum pattern.

Finally the bass line, I tried running it through the Eurorack, but the Eurorack was just eating the sound up. I definitely need to dig into this more, and probably just need to do another track with -9db, but I forgot to do this. Instead I just routed the bass straight out of the MPC channels 1/2, which again, leaves me with the problem that I cannot use the WAV Recorder to recording in a pristine sound. It's possible I should disconnect from the Morphagene and go directly into the Befaco ST Mix... as it seems that doing it this way it is slightly less distorted, but... well need to explore this more.

From here, all of the MPC 1/2 output is going into the SP 202 (was going to do some overall mix LPF work manually... but did not) and then into the SP 303 for some Vinyl Sim compressor, noise, and wow/flutter just to give the track a bit more movement on the tail end.
