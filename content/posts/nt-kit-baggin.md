Still taking a break from wrist issues, but I had some time to throw together a new drum kit. Baggin is a few different sounds I was messing with elsewhere, and probably don't really go together, but I think I'm going to have to try and put a track together. Likely it's going to take a bit of FX and filter to tame, but I figured I'd post up the samples for anybody who is interested. I've got the pads color coded, so hopefully it'll help you around the patch a bit.
