This is a track I have been working on for about a week on the PO-33. All the sampling and mixing was done within the little box. I continue to like this little device because it really forces you to think about a potentially crippling amount of sampling time and a very real four note polyphony limit. Some of the previous tracks I have done really ran into the polyphony wall, and it doesn't exactly drop notes the way I would expect at least.

All that said, I really just wanted to create a more fresh and summery track this time around. The piano if I recall was an A minor chord, and I recorded in the bass note as an A#. From there I just searched around for a few beats, and ended up settling for a beat that needed some work in the PO-33 to square it away because it was kind of noisy and while it had movement needed some other help. I followed that with recording some scratching in so that I could chop that up and make some scratch variations throughout the song.

I ended up pretty quickly settling on a four bar loop that was the initial drums, scratching, bass, and piano. With some vocals this would absolutely have been enough to carry the song for as long as somebody wanted to record, but I wasn't quite happy with the vocals I was coming up with. If there is a track I will come back to some day with vocals though, this is likely the one!

Anyways... this was about a week ago, and I had intended to finish the track while I was out on a trip with my family and my parents up north. I brought the PO-33 and my OP-1 with me and was intending to record the pattern into the OP-1 and then go through and try some vocals, and then settling in for some mixing in master. Through some unfortunate events though the OP-1 got lost... it has since been found, but it is not in my possession at this time. Doh.

What with having the week off, and finishing off some beat battle tracks, I really figured I should just dust off the PO-33 and get this track down. I did some mastering work in the Akai MPC mk2, and then exported it out to Ableton Live for some minor arrangement changes. Overall I am happy with the track, but I feel like this is absolutely asking for some kind of remix. I ended up spending some time with the PO-32 to fill out some of the drum sounds, and this one patch based off of the PO-32 ended up consuming the bulk of my PO-33 sample time. Doh...

I did try to do some lyrics on the PO-35, and while it didn't sound bad, it wasn't really the tone I was going for. I probably should have saved it off first though, because somehow the speed knob got hit, and none of the samples I recorded line up with the PO-33 track. Ugh... so sad... but it is what it is, right?

Well, I guess I am off for the day. Back to fiddling and getting another track finished if possible.
