I found more album and artwork things! So let's just get right to it for this, my second album, and originally published (okay, I burned it myself and printed out all the artwork) as a two album discography for friends and family. I'm willing to bet that all the copies made it to the trash or got exposed to the sun ruining my nicely burned CDs. Yeah, that was a thing back in the day.

\[bandcamp width=100% height=120 album=2758447608 size=large bgcol=ffffff linkcol=0687f5 tracklist=false artwork=small\]

Good news, I'm finding a lot of this older content, bad news, I'm starting to see gaps in my older self's ability to organize and keep track of everything. I'm missing a lot of album artwork, and not so sure how much of it I can find. Boo on me, but I'll keep digging as I get this site back together!
