It is on! Going to hit up a track a day, with the goal of hitting 300 tracks posted to soundcloud by the end of the year. This should get me within striking distance of, six tracks left to do afterwards I think... I'll have to try and just hit that before the end of the month. Maybe do a couple tracks a day to fill it out :D

The picture is courtesy of the long walk I I took after dropping a vehicle off for repair. Just walking the streets of Nashua and saw some interesting stuff that I thought would make for some interest Ps Camera fodder. Kinda dug how the galaxy effect came out for this one.

The track itself was put together from mostly chopped loops, and some rather rapid tweaks in the drum kit program files. Nothing extreme, but a few of the hits needed to be pitched, adjust in volume, or apply some ADSR so that it wasn't quite so overpowering. The piano sound... so that was pitched down -12db, and then run through the granular filter with a pitch back up +12db. I think there's something interesting to do sound design wise, but it also sounded a bit like a mess in the context of the song. On the other hand, I figured I'd just leave it in, it's my first day, and that piano wasn't hurting anybody :D

I also ran the whole thing through Yorgos' Mastering, and then needed to do a pretty large amount of filter to get the sound remixed and under control, because it was knocking the doors off in a bad way.
