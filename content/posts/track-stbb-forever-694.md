New Beat Battle up at [STBB Forever #694](https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=682). Was a fun one, and I pulled content from the four tracks. A lot of cool things to sample, and the rules were effectively no hats, and record your own percussion.

I pulled a lot of fun glass bell, horns, strings, piano, etc... all sounded really good. I just focussed on straight up one shot type sounds, and maybe a few hits with a bit of extra sound on them. I was able to put together quite a few tracks and sequences on the MPC, but honestly a lot of them just didn't work together well, so I grabbed the sections I thought worked well enough and strung them together as best I could. So yeah, not exactly proud of this track, but I am trying to keep putting tracks together and retraining my ear for these things.

Anyways, enjoy the track for what it is, and have a great day! :D
