title: Track - Right in the Kisser

It's kind of funny... because after doing the two months of making a track a day back to back... I feel like my flow has transitioned to just putting stuff down in a different sort of way, making it a bit more raw...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/right-in-the-kisser

The picture is from a few years back, when Amy was more of a spring chicken. she's still quite an active dog, but she definitely prefers to be laying down on a lap, or being held. Still curious to explore and see new things, but not quite so bold as she once was.

The samples came out of the Loopmasters Tranquility set. It's a trap kit, and I figured I'd grab it since I had picked up some other packs and had points or whatever... so it wasn't something I was going out of my way for... but I also wanted to just check it out. I didn't feel like hunting and pecking for sounds this morning, but just wanted to lay something down. I \*kind\* of tried to find things that were in key, but then promptly did some transpositions and \*shrug\* I went for what seemed to sound good.

Track wise...

I wasn't looking to do anything fancy... I just chopped up a drum sample and ignored that most of the sample existed. I mean... guys... you make a sample pack, and then create a drum loop for example that is 128 chops, but only has maybe 4-5 different sounds. Is this really necessary?! Honestly, it makes it feel like filler to me... could've been a 2 bar loop instead of a monster 16 or 32 bar loop that just keeps repeating. At least put a filter sweep or something in there so that the sound changes a bit over time or across every few measures. Something to at least justify why it just keeps going on and on! At any rate... I just settled on a pattern that repeated... didn't care to get fancy, and wanted to move myself out of my usual drum rhythms that I'll tap out myself.

The chops were mostly straight forward as well. When chopping up the pianos I noticed some notes were chords, and some had some little flourishes to them, so once I chopped it up, I figured I would go into the pad color to only light up the pads I wanted to use. I considered trying to use some of the other notes, but the BPM was way off for what I was trying to put together.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1713.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

As you can see above, I just lit up pad 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Mostly so I could make sure I didn't accidentally use pads that had nothing on them or that I figured would sound bad in the track. Nothing too exciting honestly, but just helps keep you in the flow if you're not committed to memorizing what is good/bad out of every chop. Spoiler alert, it's not something I usually care to memorize :D

For both the Vox and the Strings I ended up duplicating the program (program pencil -> duplicate)... but for two very different reasons.

For the Strings... I wanted to have two different styles... a more chopped but sustained sound, and a second almost scratching kind of rhythmic sound. Honestly, I could have done this with a single track, but I was having a bit of a problem when I muted the cut strings, and then moving the sustained sound that it was cutting the sustained sounds short. I suspect that even though the midi notes in the cut strings track were muted, somehow it was interacting with the sustained track notes. Not sure, didn't care to dig deep, just duplicated that track and moved on.

On the other hand, the Vox program was a bit different. I did a region chop, and found I really dug the tail part of the Vox program a lot, but wanted the full Vox notes to also have the tail. Easy enough, just unlink the chop regions and then adjust the notes to fit. Effectively the Vox part was stretched to include the tail in the chop, and then the tail chop was just left as is. Since the tail was so much more quiet, I added the Enhancer effect which sounded great.

Or rather, it sounded great until I figured I'd try moving to the YA Master setup. You see, once I moved into the YA Master, the Vox was crackling super fierce when the full sound would come in. I tried disabling the Enhancer, but this turned out to sound pretty bad still. What I clearly was going to do was change the mix levels on the Vox, but then this put the tail sections into a "too quiet to be useful". There's several ways I could have fixed this, but I decided the faster solution was just to duplicate the program, so that for the tail chops I could have the Enhancer effect on, and for the full Vox chops I could remove the enhancer and drop the track a bit lower in the mix. This was a much faster way to manage the problem than trying to remix everything, mess around with a compressor, or take each tail section and give it it's own Enhancer plugin.
