Just messing around way more today than I have all month... but this is for better or worse lol :D

So the Jam Session... just loaded up a kit and figured I'd mess around for 10-15 minutes

Near the end I had no idea what I had in the Morphagene buffers, and just kind of went with it. Not really choices I should have made, but whatever... just messing around.

Ended up taking what I made from the drum kit and just putting a bit of a rough track together... wasn't really sure what else to do :/

Wanted to spend more time on a track or two today, but ended up building a rail post and a gate to help keep the puppies on the deck and prevent them from escaping! Just the left post was probably 4 hours of time... then building the gates and installing it was at least two, but maybe three more hours.

So musically today felt a bit like a bust, but on the other hand I did get a project done.
