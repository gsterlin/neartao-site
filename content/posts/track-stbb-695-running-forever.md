This track comes courtesy of [STBB Forever BB #695](https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=691&sid=7d0cdf19c7200d2c7faafcb7c573a9ee), there were two tracks to chop up. The rules were effectively to chop whatever, use your own drums, no external instruments, and you needed to drop a change up in the track. I'm interested to see what others do this week.

Similar to the MPC BB this week, I was really crunched for time to work on this. This time however I decided I would just do the track in the PO-33, and make it a quick flip. So I loaded the tracks into the MPC, but didn't even bother chopping on the MPC, I just shuffled the starting point around the tracks and sampled in what ever I wanted to start or stop, and was able to get four or five interesting chops pretty quickly from the first track. For the second track, I just sampled roughly a loop, and let the auto chopper do it's magic, or horrible destruction.

From there, I did need some drums, and I sourced a pretty simple drum loop that had some movement in the sound just so I could change up the hits a little bit either over time or for the drops.

To build up the patterns, I mostly just built out 4 bar loops on the PO-33, copied them, and then made a version that had some effects. I did this for both sections of the song. Once I had this done, I really need to spend time working on the change up, because going from song one to song two was a bit of a mess. Sadly, I couldn't really fix it up as much as I wanted, predominantly because of the limitations of the four note polyphony, I just could not have as many sounds playing at once as I wanted, which made it a bit awkward.

All into the song, I probably spent about 30-40 minutes. If I had more time, what I probably should have done was to create a drop track, and then a build up track. I did seriously consider this, but in the end, I figured what I had was good enough to put to use as a song. It's not a winner, but hey, I'm still getting tracks together. No matter what though, I do have to say, you can get an amazing amount done on a PO-33, it definitely can function as a little sampling workhorse.
