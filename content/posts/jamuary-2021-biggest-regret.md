Day two of #jamuary 2021

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/biggest-regret

The picture comes courtesy of my daughter finding a frog in the backyard over the summer and we caught a few pictures of it. She was super excited to have found such a small critter hanging out in the back yard and just wanted to get a few close ups of the little guy (or gal).

I fiddled with this track a bit throughout the day and it never quite came together the way I wanted. I tried to play everything out by hand as much as possible, and well... I find it okay. The transitions between sections are particularly week again, and I know I could have done better to build up more energy if I had just had the time. Instead I decided to cut my losses on this track and move forward to preparing for day three instead... which meant this track suffered.

This is also another day of working on the Akai MPC Live, Waldorf Iridium, and Access Virus combo... which I am digging as a great few devices to play together with. My biggest gripe is just how poorly the MPC Live handles audio track recording from midi, exporting and all that. It works, but there are so many gotchas that it becomes a bit annoying to remember to get all of the steps done correctly and make it work. I should probably just write down my process and refine it... but I guess then I won't have a nebulous problem to loosely complain about :D.
