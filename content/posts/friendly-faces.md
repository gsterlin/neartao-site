The picture comes from a trip to Greece I took two years ago with my family.

Was trying to put something a bit more LoFi sounding together, and I kind of feel like I failed. The mix is just off, and it doesn't really feel dirty enough. Overall, I find the bass too loud and it probably needs some major taming. What was I thinking? Uhm... not sure lol!
