Wooooo.... as my daughter would say

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/it-is-gone

The picture is from ages ago when we took my daughter to the Friendly Farm to see some animals when she was a toddler I think... the FX may make the bunny look like it is taking off... but if we're being real, it was just laying on some concrete and could not care about us. We had no food, so the meat bags weren't of any importance to it :D. Miss the days when she was excited to spend time with me, but now that she's a teenager, well... she's got other interests.

This track guys... I feel like I'm redeemed an awful lot, especially given the junk I've been doing for a few days now. Just getting back into the groove of work, my wife coming home late, and my daughter's crazy new schedule... it's been hard to juggle everything... and still put out a track a day. Yesterday I was just about ready to throw in the towel and call it quits... but yo... this track feels \*good\*... and even though it came together pretty quickly I didn't feel like I phoned it in.

Honestly... a lot of things I have been learning, re-experiencing, pushing myself in, all that... just felt like it's come together quite well in this track. I picked my battles with the sequencer and tracks, used track mutes and song mode to build something up, and then went back to add in some flair and really kick the track up a notch. It's feeling good I say!

On the other hand... the tragedy of having to upload it three times... because I phoned in the upload... well... that's entirely on me for being a bozo. What happened you ask? Well the first upload entirely missed the "keys" track... I'm not sure what I managed to do wrong there exactly, but I munged it up for sure. So to make things better... I added the track in and re-uploaded it... but \*damn\* I didn't mix it in properly... which left me with this instrument that was a bit too punchy and needed to be tamed back into submission.

So the upload process was a bit of an adventure, but here's another track I definitely want to work on when I get back from my dropping a track a day.
