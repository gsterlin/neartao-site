Just another quick painting that I did. I was testing out how well the paper would handle darker paint, and I'm still going to say with the pencil board behind the page, it is hardly relevant and doesn't really impact my ability or distract me from writing on the next page.

I've come to the conclusion that controlling the amount of water you put on the page is important, but I haven't noticed the color lifting off of the page and rubbing on older pages yet. Better I haven't noticed water coloring on one page impacting a painting on the other side of the paper. I am positive I can make this a problem, but so far it hasn't bothered me.

I'll keep doing some little paintings for fun and to experiment, but I'm actually quite happy at how well the Tomo River paper is holding up to my experiments so far!
