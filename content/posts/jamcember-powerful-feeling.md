Welcome to day numero six. I started this little number about two weeks ago... just before I wanted to try and put out a track a week.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/powerful-feeling

The picture is... probably eight years old now? There were some monks making mandalas in my home town and I have some interesting videos of the work they did. The level of concentration is impressive to put together these images, and you can see they are using masks to make sure the do not disturb the sand while they are making the picture. It's a pretty cool process, and it was fun to watch. My daughter got a kick out of it, and I have a video where one of the monks helped her make her own tiny image out of sand.

Back to the track. The drum break is actually what I used to do my S950 to S1000 test a few weeks back. Maybe two weeks now? I forget, and am being too lazy to go look it up. At any rate, I played around with the break a bit to adjust the timing, and did some small amount to flip it in a few places for the track, but honestly nothing too serious. It felt like it was really lacking some high hats, so I added that in, and kind of got this chord vibe going, with a slapping bass sample.

From what I had put together, I figured it wasn't quite enough to really make a track out of, so I dug out some piano and a kind of weird Pad FX sample. Which I subsequently went to town by filtering, especially the Pad FX, which I turned into this odd kind of chant sound using the built in Akai FX. The piano, well... I automated a slow HP filter sweep on it through the middle to the end of it playing, and had it slowly finish out with some Akai FX tape delay to add some Wow and Flutter. It's passable in the mix, but doesn't sound quite so great on it's own.

Beyond that, I wasn't too stoked to do a bunch of builds, drops, and main sections, so I just decided to build off of five 8 bar loops, and make a track out of it. Listening back, the track kind of suffers from this because some of the sections are a bit more repetitive than they should be, and worse, there isn't really much to add any kind of tension or movement in the track. It drives forward in a way, but there's just too much time between anything interesting happening. If I ever went back to this track I'll have to remember that it needs a riser or reverse crash or something to also help with transitions. The track isn't asking for much... but as it stands it feels kind of like an over all dud even if I do really like different parts of the track.
