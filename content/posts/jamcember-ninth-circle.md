Here's to slugging out the last track for December, and heading into the new year!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ninth-circle

This track came about from creating an audio track from a 32 bar loop on the Access Virus TI2 Darkstar. I automated a few parameters and figured it sound cool enough to add some drums and FX to it. I wanted to try and get something slower and more droning this time around, instead of some of the faster and more manic tracks I have been laying down the last month.

I had spent a lot of time automating different parts of each sound, and when I was ready to export it, I did something wrong and had lost all of the automation. This was a huge bummer, and I am not quite sure why the Q-Links didn't maintain what I had put together. I'll definitely need to scratch my head and figure out what happened... because I was switching automation lanes from Read to Write, using over dub... all that fun stuff... I am certain I took a misstep, and again, I am not quite sure what it was.

Oh well... there's always next year to figure it out :D
