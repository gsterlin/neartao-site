Just knocking something out fairly quickly over lunch for day.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-grace

The picture is from years ago... Aruba I think? I'll have to look it up and see if I can figure it out.

To make the track, I did another fake 4 bar loop to turn into a vaporwave track. So quite similar process to the last few days. The big difference here is \*way\* more automation, filtering, and for the first half of the song I used the Air Halfspeed plugin to make the vaporwave component feel slower. The whole track was going much much slower than I usually go for, so I really just tried to lock in what felt like a leaned way back vibe and go with it.

Hope you enjoy!
