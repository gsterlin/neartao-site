The picture is from my daughter walking away from me going to the mall.

My wrist is still really sore. Talked to the nurse, they can get me in to see me in about a week. Said to try some Ibuprofen in the meantime.

I don't think hitting the pads is causing me problems, this is similar to some issues I've had in the past, but far more extreme. Not really sure, but stretching seems to help. Also trying to avoid typing quite so much for work. Wish me luck!
