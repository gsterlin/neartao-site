Merry Christmas Eve!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/east-coast-comfort-food

I put this track together from just three samples... a drum break... an acoustic bass... and a piano melody. Nothing too fancy, but I wanted to spend the time today making different patterns from the different samples and then mixing it up and seeing how it came together.

I'm not exactly stoked by the track itself, but it does feel like it is worth taking the time to make a few change ups this way, even if I'm limited to doing a track a day. Honestly, it wasn't too much more work, and I think where the results worked... well they did work out well. It's just that I need to make the time to do it. Normally for these daily tracks I have been trying to just get one 4 or 8 bar chunk sounding "just right", but then I end up trying to make it sound interesting by dropping sections, building, etc...

More food for thought to go back to as I'm trying to wrap up this month of making tracks.
