This is the eighteenth track for #jamuary2021... only thirteen(?) to go?!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/piece-of-mine

Picture is from my dog Amy... she was totally chilling the other day. Well, honestly, she chills every day! That's her secret, she's always relaxed. Except when the wind is blowing leaves around... then she's full attack mode. Other than that though, she's conserving her energy.

For you folks out there not making stuff... whether it is dope or whack... come on... get yourself out there! I'm definitely hearing some great stuff coming from folks just trying to put things down, but there's quite a few peeps with a lot of gear just sitting on their laurels. Get your freak on and put something together!

I am trying to spend a bit less time the next time to put tracks together, just to work on myself. My knees or messed up a bit and I just need to get focussed back on myself. So, I just grabbed a few loops, chopped stuff up, and went to town. I know the track mutes for parts coming in and out is messed up, but I'm just done working on this fun track for today. As I have said before, there is some beauty in just dropping the track and moving on.

So what's your excuse? :D
