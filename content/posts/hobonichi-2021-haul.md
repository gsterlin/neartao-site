My Hobonichi order finally showed up!

The packaging from Hobonichi has always been fun, and the quotes are interesting.

... and as always, everything is well organized inside of the box.

This year I figured I would pick up a couple of the Drawer Pouches that match as close as I could with my Porter cousin case. From the pictures I wasn't quite sure what I was going to get, but wanted to check them out. Both seem like they probably are better with flatter content, though I will give it a try and see if I can get washi tape to fit in here well enough or not.

I also picked up the new Hobonichi Techo 2021 cousin, which came with the Fude pen, which I'll be checking out for some artwork, and the 3 color pen that has black, red, and blue. I really liked this pen from previous years, so will definitely be keeping this. I also got some of the landscape index tabs to help make it a bit easier to read through the cousin by month.
