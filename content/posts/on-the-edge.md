This track comes courtesy of my Eurorack build. I am working on trying to clean up content I have recorded on the 4MS WAV RECORDER, and found this. It was reasonably complete enough that I figured I'd just post it up as is. There isn't anything too fancy going on, but it was fun to put together.

This isn't really a finished project, and was something I was more interested in playing around with some ideas for a live performance. It was really just pulling together a bass line, some drums, and a freaked out probably over processed evolving space sound. From there I just used some basic mixing components to evolve some of the sounds by turning knobs.

There is another version I recorded where I played around with the tempo to drive some crazier parts of the production, but it's not terribly coherent, so I decided I will probably just farm it for sounds in a future song that I'll put together.
