This was done yesterday, but family interrupted and I couldn't get it posted.

Changes here amount to maybe another hour worth of work, primarily focussed on the Sampling section. I figured it would be a good idea to add a Gain Staging section, although this is stubbed out for now. I do feel like I finished the Controls for External Source section for now. I did start on the Microphone/Guitar section, but I'm going to have to get some pedals and guitars hooked up first to verify a few things.

Should have more time today though, to keep things moving :D
