title: S950 and S1000 White Noise and Drum Break Comparison
url: /2020/11/27/s950-and-s1000-white-noise-and-drum-break-comparison/

A conversation started on MPC Forums about the [MPC & S900/950 Routing Question](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=206423). We got into details about how the S900/S950 worked, which then lead into S900/S950 samples sounding more full on the S1000 and later. I ended up taking a stab at sampling both white noise and a drum break on the S950 with a bandwidth of 3000 and 19200, and then playing the notes across the key group to get some samples together. Below is the project and recordings from the S950 and S1000 for your own listening.

In this project you'll find two files that start with "Original", these are the original white noise and drum break files that I played out from the MPC Live into the S950 to record. I recorded both two times into the S950 at both a bandwidth of 3000 and 19200. These are just saved as generic tone programs, but I've uploaded these as well in case you've got a device with a USB reader that can manage .hfe files, or if you have a way to load them onto a floppy disk. These files are below.

For all of the key groups/samples, C3 is the original sample recorded, and I tried to time stretch the content up and down from C0 to C5. However, things got a little fiddly, especially on the S1000, it didn't want to stretch the sample down so far. I'm not terribly sure why, might be a program issue with the key group, or perhaps the S1000 cannot stretch a sample down so far. I'll have to poke at it a bit more. If I decided to do more comparisons for a single sample, I think I will go C1 to C4 next time. The auto sampler was a stride of 4, so it's not a one to one for every semi tone stretch, but plenty of the samples here you can straight compare.

Now, with all of that out of the way, you can listen to the samples for yourself. Either check out the exact samples, or go to Track 3 and swap between two of the programs. You can definitely hear that the S1000 does something differently with the samples that the high end is a bit more audible. I suspect that the S950 has some form of non resonant low pass filter, but it is also possible that the algorithms for converting the S950 program to an S1000 program does something fancy to anti-alias or otherwise transform the samples to 16-bit that just makes it sound a bit better. Honestly I am not sure, but clearly if you want a bit more high end from those old 12 bit samples you'll want to try the samples out on the S1000. I have no doubt by applying the S1000 low pass filter that you could get it to sound pretty close to the S950. On the other hand, this is interesting, and I'll have to see if there are any other experiments to follow in this space.
