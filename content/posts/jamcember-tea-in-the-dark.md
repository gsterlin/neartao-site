Day twenty... I can feel that the end of jamcember is nearing :D

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/tea-in-the-dark

Today I went back to the now "old" standard of making some loops in Reason Studio, working on some sound design to get some interesting sounds, and then bouncing the loops out to be chopped.

A few things I tried to switch it up. First, I made four bar loops, but extended them out to eight bars, because I wanted the ambience to flow through to the start of the first bar, instead of hearing the loop in the first bar kind of catch up. Something sounds a bit off... it's possible that I have an LFO that is not sync'd to the track, or maybe my copy/paste of notes was bad. I tried it... and while it didn't work quite how I wanted, well... it still produced results.

Once I chopped up the loops, I spent some time in Program mode this time trying to adjust the ADSR to eliminate chops without having to find 0 points for every slice. This had varying success... but quickly makes the cuts sound like they are being volume gated, which wasn't really the sound I was going for. I \*think\* I could have solved this a bit by switching the drum kits from mono to a polyphonic sound, but I kind of gave up on fixing it in this track because at the end of the day, it didn't really matter that much to me.

The second thing I did was once I had the song exported back out as a sequence, I spent some time adding in some extra notes and flourishes. I tried not to go overboard, but I wanted to get a few notes in there to help tie things together. I think for moving forward I should also try being a bit more laid back with the sequences, and then tighten it up once I have moved back off of song mode. Will have to wait and see.
