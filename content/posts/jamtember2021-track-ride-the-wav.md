Well today I felt like messing around with making a vaporwave styled song...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ride-the-wav

Another picture courtesy of my trip to Hawaii. Really gorgeous island, and could definitely just hang out at the beach for days.

To make vaporwave you usually take some old 80's music, find a loop, time stretch it way down, and then drop a beat on top of it... maybe some filtering, reverb, or other fx to boot, but the idea is super easy to do.

For building my 80's inspired loop, I just put together something that I thought we sound good for an acoustic house style instrumental, something that'd run around 120-130 bpm, and settled on 128.13bpm being the sweet spot for me. I then recorded the track out to the SP 202 using LoFi 1, which added some of the digital distortion and metallic ringing sound. From there, I used PITCH on the 202 to drop the pitch down all the way, and definitely dug the sound of it. I added a hint of Lowpass filter on the 202 as well to just take off a bit of that digital LoFi 1 edge, and recorded the loop back into the MPC.

Recording into the MPC took a few tries though, since I wasn't starting square on the 1 for starting to play, and the 202 was looping so I was trying to be fancy and record a perfect loop, and just gave up on that. Instead I recorded the bass/synth/guitar mix in after starting recording on the 202, and then gave it an extra beat or two to play out before ending the recording. Recording time was definitely an issue, because the 202 is pretty tight for internal storage, which is the \*only\* way you can adjust pitch on the 202, with internally recorded sounds.

With the loop recorded, I went off to Sample Edit in the MPC, and set the start/end for the loop to work correctly over the four bars that I selected, discarded the rest, and then assigned the loop to a pad on Program 1 and named it Vapor.

At this point, I just created a second drum kit so that I could have a kick, snare, and a couple of hats that I could keep separate for insert fx from the main core Vapor. I laid out a super basic house style kick hat snare hat pattern, and was off. I did filter the drums down a touch, enough for the hats/snare to have presence, but not so much for them to tear through the mix.

With the basic drum pattern out of the way I figured it was time to focus on automation for the Vapor track. I simply put a low pass filter in place, and just adjust it roughly ever 4 bars so that more or less of the high end was coming through. This helped give the track some movement and build up, without having to spend a lot of time figure out drops and such. I did go through a tweak the drums a bit by hand, and honestly if I had exploded the drum track and then recorded track mutes this probably would have been a bit faster, but this seemed to come out pretty well.
