Just posting a short video to show the gear I use to get both cabled audio and midi from my iPad to my Akai MPC Live II.

Equipment:

[HyperDrive HD319](https://www.hypershop.com/products/hyperdrive-6-in-1-hub-for-ipad?variant=19332717412414&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6_zJpem38AIV42xvBB3r6w-6EAQYASABEgJJAfD_BwE) \- I linked to the Hyper Drive site, but this is around $80-$90. Personally I shopped around and was able to get it with discounts/sales at Best Buy a year ago for $60. It does give you a lot of features though, so definitely worth checking out if it is compatible with your iPad.

[Roland UM-ONE](https://www.roland.com/us/products/um-one/) \- This is the USB Midi interface I used for the USB to Midi conversion. Nothing special about it, but it does work as a generic USB device, making it compatible with the iPad.

Hope this helps you out!
