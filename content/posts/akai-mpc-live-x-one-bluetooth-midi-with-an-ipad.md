Setting up Midi over Bluetooth and the MPC is dead simple, and I figured I'd take some time to make a quick video and write this up for everybody else to enjoy. You've at least got to give it a try! I kicked this video off from a post Dan B made over at MPC Forums [Connecting iPad & EXT Midi Controllers to MPC Live...](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=210326&p=1824493#p1824493)

Introduction

I just recorded a video to show how to setup Bluetooth Midi between an Akai MPC Live/X/One and an iPad. I have done these steps with an iPhone as well, and suspect that it would work just fine with plenty of other devices that support Midi over Bluetooth as well.

https://youtu.be/BwwPZVgMoe4

If you'd prefer not to watch the video and want to watch the steps below, then feel free to follow along that way.

MPC & iPad Bluetooth Setup

Let's start from your Main menu.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1680.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

From here, you'll want to touch the House icon in the upper left to get into your options.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1681.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

From this menu touch the gear icon so that we can dig into your MPC's Preferences.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1682.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

The Preferences menu has a section for Bluetooth settings, so touch that.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1683.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

You can see that in my Bluetooth preferences above, that Bluetooth was set to of, so go ahead and turn that on.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1684.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

With Bluetooth turned on, it is going to start looking for both Paired Devices and Available Devices for it to connect to. Essentially Paired Devices are what you are able to connect when both devices are on, and Available Devices is what you have the option to pair with, but are not paired yet.

In my case above, nothing is available, so I need to power something on that can then I can make it available.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1685-1.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Above is the Home Screen of my iPad, and I'll need to go to my iPad settings to get the other half of the Bluetooth pairing started. Assuming you have Bluetooth turned on for your iPad, once it is started, your MPC should be able to see it.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1687.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Heading back to my MPC, I can now see the iPad is an Available device for my iPad to pair with. Go ahead and select your iPad and then touch the Pair button.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1688.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Once you have touched the Pair button on the MPC, you will see a popup request on your iPad, asking you if you would like to pair the two together.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1689-1.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Go ahead and select Pair on your iPad. But do not that the MPC is going to tell you that this failed. It's okay, we'll fix it shortly.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1690.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Above, you can see on the iPad that it says the MPC Live II (in my case) is not connected, all you need to do is touch "Not Connected" on your iPad and it will connect.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1691.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

And viola, we now have a Bluetooth connection established between the iPad and the MPC! Now we can get some of the fun to begin.

Navichord Setup

Here you can see I loaded up Navichord, this is a great tool for playing out notes and chords!

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1693.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

If you touch the gear icon, you'll be able to open up the settings menu so that you can tell it to send midi notes out to your MPC. Go ahead and touch MIDI from the menu.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1694.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Now this might be confusing, but with Navichord, do not go to the Bluetooth MIDI menu, this would seem obvious, but this is for specific types of Bluetooth MIDI devices... which we're not using in this example... or at least the MPC does not meet those standards at this time. Instead you want to touch MIDI I/O.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1701.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Above you can see that in this case I only care about outputting notes to the MPC, and not at all interested in inputs. Definitely experiment, but if you're only looking to play notes on the iPad to your MPC, then make sure the Outputs MPC Notes button is selected so that you can send notes from Navichord.

Chord Maps 2 Setup

Chord Maps 2 is another great application for playing Midi notes to your MPC.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1695.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Once you load it up, you have all kinds of options. This might look overwhelming as an application, and it kind of is, but it is really worth checking out. At any rate, to get yourself setup, click on the i icon in the upper left.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1696.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Above you see that the MPC Live II Bluetooth is a possible destination, but I haven't enabled it yet. Let's go ahead and do that.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img%5F1697.jpeg?w=1024" alt="" caption="" >}}

Once you've got a checkmark set, you're now able to play notes from the iPad into your MPC. Just make sure you've got a key group loaded :)
