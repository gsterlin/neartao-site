For day 27... I missed the mark...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/broken-garage

So not really a garage... but boy was that toy for my daughter busted. I ended up upgrading it with a bunch of additions like a tiny and working tv inside, fixed up the doorbell, it was a pretty rocking little house. When we got it though, it was broken as heck...

Kind of like the song I put together. I was kind of thinking about going for a House track... and as you listen to it you can tell I kind of split between an acid baseline, and some other sounds in there... and never really committed to a garage track, or a UK track... or anything else. It straddles the line, but not in a good way. I suspect I need to burn this track with fire... but today I had been working on two or three other tracks to started out with... and just never was happy with anything. I guess not every day can be decent or above.
