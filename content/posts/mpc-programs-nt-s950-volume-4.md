Got some more S950 programs sampled, but first, here's the link.

[NT - S950 v4](/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v4.zip) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nt-s950-v4.zip)

The big thing I learned this time around was that from the Sampler menu, if you select a mono source and set the sampling to mono... well I didn't have to use Fission to covert the samples to mono. That saved some headaches for sure!

Overall notes for the auto sampling:  
\\* 430 Mono samples  
\\* Should play from C-2 to G8  
\\* Sampled C0 to C5 in most cases, with a stride of 4  
\\* Generally 16 samples per program  
\\* Only one Sample Layer at velocity of 127

16 programs, which breaks down to:

- 3 Bass Bassoon
- 1 Cello
- 1 Saxaphone
- 1 String
- 12 Synth
- 5 Trumpet

Enjoy, and have fun with these sounds!
