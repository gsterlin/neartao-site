28 tracks this month... and looking forward to a break... just three more to go :D

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ethical-bad-boy

The picture is from years ago... doing an extended family vacation out in Maine... Jamaica Point?!? Great area, lots of trees, water, everything you could ask for if you wanted a secluded get away. I believe the place we stayed at was originally a camp, it could sleep probably 25-40 people... massive/sprawling kitchen... all that fun stuff. Ended up going out on a boat a lot... plenty of hikes in the woods. It was fun :D

For the track, I was just fishing into some more experimental sounds, and found the drums... detuned them 6 semitones and then for some reason it felt like a DnB track so I just rolled with it. A few key groups were made for the bass, and an attempted piano chord... but I could not work out how to fit the piano chords into the track at all... it was pitched incorrectly and was quite jarring... in an almost fun way... but not going to happen today.

As usual with a DnB track, you end up spending as much time on it as a normal track tweaking everything... but because it is so much faster you end up with only half the content. So... booooo the track is under a minute... but yeah... I am still at least getting a halfway decent track out at all.

Still in the process of moving. I feel like half or more of my life is in boxes right now. Most of the instruments are boxed, I am missing cables I need to work with a few devices... so it is getting to be time to call it quits on music made with the MPC for a bit. I will probably try and find something else to mess around with... it just won't be quite so MPC focussed. Or is this my excuse to get back to the MPC 500 and projects I have there? Hmmmm...
