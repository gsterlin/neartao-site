Dropping this track... now... folks in the MPC Forums have seen this in my sig for a while now... I've just been super lazy in posting.

The ride I happened to see while I was grabbing ice cream and had to take a picture. While I don't want to old one of these older vehicles, I can appreciate them when I see them!

This was done almost entirely on the MPC X for sequencing sections and building it out into a song... in song mode. Haha!

In writing it, the song sounded way too clean to me. As it stands, it's now way too muddy, but that was the sound I was looking for. Making it all good right?

To really get the muddy sound I ran the track through my Chase Bliss Audio pedals, specifically I got a lot of work from Condor for tweaking the EQ... and this was quite heavy handed since I wasn't worrying about mixing and master the track... so I was doing some lazy 3 band eq filter mixing... because that's all you've got from Condor. If I had tracked everything out through it, one track at a time a 3 eq band can definitely suffice, but yeah... for a final mix without really any thought to mixing tracks, this is a quick way to get a bit muddy. Again though... I didn't care for this track and it was half of the point.

The other muddy buddy in here is the Generation Loss. You can hear that I went pretty noticeable on the wow/flutter, and there's a bit of VHS tape noise simulation in the mix that I filtered down with the LP filter. Ultimately I was going for a sound that really sounded like some of my old tapes that had been used and abused a bit too much, and this is where my memory took me.

Is it too much? Absolutely! Am I happy with the results? Absolutely! One of these days I might put up the clean version of the track, but for now I will let this stand as it is.
