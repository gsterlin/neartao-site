title: Track - Sounds of the Old Reliquary

Boy, I thought I had posted this track a while ago... heck I made it nearly a year ago, but here it is.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/old-sounds-of-the-reliquary

I put this track together in about an hour, and it was recorded on the Teenage Engineering OP-1 in conjunction with a Bastl Instruments Micro Granny. I spent a lot of time working out sounds to get it fairly noisy, and making it sound like it had some dark, odd vocal sounding components. The Micro Granny provided a lot of the ground work for those sounds, and I then spent some time to find string instruments on the OP-1 and played them at various tape speeds to get a more stretched out sound.

The Micro Granny is absolutely the star here though, and did most of the heavy lifting to get the interesting sounds that came out particularly distorted. It was not too hard to load up different sounds into the Granny and then play with the pitch and grain size to get interesting pulsating and dark sounds. It's definitely a fun little device to have, and has made me on several occasions consider getting the Grandpa Eurorack module to add to my collection. Maybe some day. For now, I'll stick with the Granny!
