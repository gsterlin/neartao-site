Twenty Eight Songs In A Row... woah...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/catch-of-the-day

I'm not going to lie to you folks...

This has been a lot of back to back to back tracks for me, and I am kind of looking forward to the month ending so I can get into a different musical head space. This was just a straight up Expansion Pack kit that I loaded up, and then added a bit more to it with some samples from my brand spanking new Waldorf Iridium. I was more into just playing with the Iridium than making a track, but figured I needed to get moving and actually put something together.

To do something completely different... I tried to make a straight up 32 bar track, and then just add/remove content instead of messing with mutes and all. It felt different, though I am not sure that I am actually happy with how it worked for me. Probably a process that could be figured out for me, but it made things feel wonky. So \*shrug\*... at least I tried something new, even if it didn't work the way I wanted.
