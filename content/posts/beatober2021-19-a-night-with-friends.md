Well... here it is for today

https://youtu.be/wcvIsJlfGCI

The track gave me some problems. Mostly Total Recall... I just realized that it triggers or rather changes parameters on the down event of a clock or gate... and Pam's was sending a gate for 50% of a beat, meaning that the change was happening on 1.3 instead of 1.1 of a bar. Doh! This was giving me all kinds of problems, and I'll need to rethink how I'm using Total Recall. The quick fix was to change the gate width from 50% down to 1%, but I still feel like this leaves some margin for error. Back to the drawing board a bit for how I'm using Total recall. Surprisingly, I hadn't even noticed this until today... I guess the more ambient sounds just weren't making me notice it so much, but the arp today... woah boy... was it messing with my timing... took a few tries before I got to the "is it me, or is it you" thought... I guess at least it wasn't me this time.

I'm "okay" with how the track came out... probably too many elements and could have used some pairing down a bit. Or maybe I need to come up with a way to keep more of the original sound and not run it all through the eurorack... something to think about at least.

Have to say though, definitely getting ready to be done with this track a day for \*two\* months in a row, so I can have some time to actually work through some of the bigger problems with making a track over a day or two. Actually what I should really do is spend the time to put several tracks together... maybe a bunch of 4 track, 8 bar loops or something, and then go nuts with the eurorack and automation. Going to keep this in mind.
