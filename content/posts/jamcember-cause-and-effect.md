Just two more of these to go... holy smokes what a month!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/cause-and-effect

Picture comes courtesy of a sunset in Aruba from a couple years back. Took the family to go see the island, and we all had a blast. Heck even got my wife into the ocean for a little bit, despite her being completely afraid to hop into water!

To get the notes I played around with Orb Composer a bit in order to come up with note progressions for Arp/Bass/Chord/Melody... The key is Ab, Major scale with a chord progression of i-iv-vii-II, or Abmb7/Eb, Dbm/Ab, Gbmb7, and Bbb/Fb. I tried to use the MPC Live Performance Pads to operate in the correct scale... maybe it worked? I didn't play out too much live so it isn't exactly like it probably mattered much.

I then swiftly turned to the Waldorf Iridium to do some sound design. I'm going to have to spend some serious time to get under the hood here, because the Iridium is clearly a super deep instrument. Wowza. Speaking of... I'm attaching below the Akai MPC Live/X/One compatible programs I created for the song...

Some of the programs are trimmed properly, but some of them are not. If you're in to sample hygiene, well have fun :D. I should probably have spent more time recording these, but for doing a track a day, I wasn't exactly ready for the full commitment of putting all that work in. Let's see how things go next month once I settle down a bit.
