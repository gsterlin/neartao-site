For those of you who are hitting issues with Akai MPC 2.10 Firmware and using track mutes going to the same Drum Kit or Key Group, I have come up with a solution using Midi programs.

For those of you who want to follow along with my setup the project is available here  

[MPC 2-10 Firmwre Drum Kit Track Test](/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mpc-2-10-firmwre-drum-kit-track-test.zip) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mpc-2-10-firmwre-drum-kit-track-test.zip)

Sequence 01 has all of the tracks 01-10 pointing at the same drum kit, while Sequence 02 has all of the tracks 01-10 setup as midi tracks and sending their midi data to track 16 which is a drum kit.
