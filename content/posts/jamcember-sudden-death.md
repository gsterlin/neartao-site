The nineteenth day is upon me... and I called "Sudden Death"...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/sudden-death

There is in fact no death, but I named it as such because I really don't have much time left for the rest of the day, and had to pull something together in about 30 minutes. So instead of doing sound design in reason, today I just loaded up a pre-made drum kit... from 'LoFi Soul and Future Beats' and just went to town to knock it out.

My jam is usually to just record off the notes all in a single track, especially when it is already nicely designed into a kit. Today I did this, but wanted to try something a little different when tracking out. Instead of the normal track "explode", I decided to copy track 1 to track 17 (since I used all 16 samples), cleared the contents of track 1, and then ran explode off of track 17. To my surprise, it actually output all of the tracks into the appropriately assigned pads... Woo Doggy. Is this game changing? Well no... but it does give me some other things to consider for my workflow and trying to speed it up.

All in all, this did feel like cheating... and I mean... yeah... anybody has access to these exact sounds... but whatever... I did it my own way yo.

Take it easy folks, until tomorrow, signing off :D
