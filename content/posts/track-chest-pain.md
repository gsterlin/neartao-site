This track came together pretty quickly. Maybe two hours of goofing around on the MPC Live mk2 at most. The core of it started with me patching on my modular system, and seeing what tones I could create, and then sync'ing that to the MPC Live mk2 over CV... well technically gate signals. You can see from the picture that this is honestly not a terribly complicated patch.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8bad7823-6b1f-479f-b535-ad0aeb3ee990%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=883" alt="" caption="" >}}

This patch is what is making that sometimes bass, sometimes bloopy sound in the track. Effectively Tempi is being clocked by the MPC Live mk2 gate out, which is then clocking the Wogglebug, Brains, and a strike on the RxMx. DPO is doing the oscillator duties today, and being run into the FxDF 6db slope that is then patched into RxMx. In turn, RxMx is being filtered by the QPAS which is then going to the output. Of note, Pressure Points/Brains is being used to modulate the 1v/octave to generate the change in tones, as well as the left !! on QPAS, and the Wogglebug step modulation is driving the QPAS filter changes. I went this way to create a fair mix of "in control" and somewhat random modulation, which I recorded in as an eight bar loop in the MPC Live mk2 Looper.

From there, I loaded up a pretty standard beat loop which I chopped up, as well as chopping up the modular loop I had created, which gave me a pretty good base to create some tracks that would change a bit over time... though as you listen this isn't exactly the case, because some things I liked enough as I did two or four bar loops that I wanted to use it as is.

I then went searching for a few piano chords, and on the way found an interesting vocal that I chopped up and added some delay to so that it would have some more movement to stand out from the rest of the song.

With all of this done, I moved into mixing and a teeny tiny bit of mastering, just to help raise the overall volume of the track by eating into the headroom and putting a slightly chunky compression in place. All that said and done, I started to kick out multiple sequences to do intro, buildup, main, drop, outro sections of the song, and I pruned out some of the cruft to help keep the track moving.
