title: Gear I Have Sold Off The Last Six Months
url: /2020/06/26/gear-i-have-sold-off-the-last-six-months/

I am now down to one listing on Reverb to sell off... which kind of feels insane to me, and got me thinking about what I have sold off over the years, and why I sold it off. I also have to say, I cannot believe just how much prices have gone up over the last three months for a lot of this used gear. Yeah, I know it is not manufactured any more, and I know a lot of the stuff I have sold off people are now collecting for "that sound", but yikes are the prices crazy. Is that a weird way to say "never been a better time to sell off used gear", maybe?

Before I go into it though, my last piece of gear to sell is the Akai MPC 1000BK. I am happy it is going to somebody who is going to use it, but this piece of gear will absolutely be missed. With JJOS it has been a solid box, and I have thought several times about taking the listing down. On the other hand, I have absolutely had no reason to have three (was going to be FOUR) MPCs. Nope, I am not sequencing that much. So, I'll miss you MPC 1k, we made a lot of great beats together, but it is time for you to go to a new home.

What have I sold off recently?

- Akai MPC 1000BK - The X/Live workflow really got me, and just function that much better as an all in one solution. JJOS still has tricks up it's sleeve that the 1k could do much more simply though.
- Power Conditioners - with selling off all of this gear, I don't need quite so much power
- Korg Wavedrum - I really enjoyed this drum, it was super tactile and expressive, but it was really just getting dusty
- Korg Electribe 2 - While I enjoyed the sounds here, I am just too much into the MPC style of music production and the Electribe sounded great, but the sequencing felt limited
- Korg Electribe 2S - Similar to the other Electribe, but the sampling time was just too restrictive for my tastes.
- Moog FreqBox - I loved the sound FX here, but it just took up too much space for my needs...
- Moog RingMod - Same as above, and I've replaced it to some extent with euro rack
- Moog 12-Stage Phaser - Same as above, and also effectively replaced with euro rack
- Critter & Guitari Organelle - Calm me a doofus, but I sold it to get the Organelle M.
- Oto Biscuit - I have so many 8 bit FX, and a lot of things emulate the Biscuit today... I just couldn't justify keeping it around... I also cannot believe how much I sold it for.
- Akai S1000 8mb and 2x 2mb Memory Expansion - Upgraded my S1000 to 32mb on a single board, and was able to recoup \*some\* of the cost selling these boards off.
- Akai MPD32 - I just had no need for it, when I bought it (already had MPC) and it was sitting in the closet boxed up. Probably one of the few purchases I really regret.
- M-Audio Midisport 8x8 - As I have been simplifying the studio, I haven't had as much a need for audio routing. Super happy to sell it to somebody who was using this as their studio centerpiece and it had imploded on them... so mine was able to bring their studio back online quickly.
- Korg Kaossilator - a fun toy, but I just never got into it for making sounds.
- Akai APC40 - When I was heavy into Ableton Live, this was great... I might consider getting a Push some day, but for now I'm not a heavy Ableton Live user.
- Korg MicroKorg XL - Great memories playing around with this, especially the vocoder, with my daughter. I felt a little bit bad selling it, especially since my daughter was not so much of a fan that I sold it. She has since forgiven me.
- Korg Kaoss Pad 2 - I really really liked this FX unit, but I don't know... it hadn't fit into my workflow for years, and I couldn't bring myself to upgrading.
- Devi Ever: Hymn Strangl Synth Mangler - Oddly, this had been purchased to be an FX unit thrown into the loop on my Moog Voyager. I never really used it, but it sounded great. Sold it for quite a bit, and I hope the new owner is shredding up epic guitar riffs.
- Flame Midi Talking Synth - At one point in my life... I was going to write a program so that I could Speak n' Spell synthesize computer voice generated lyrics... this project never happened, and while it was a fun little device to mess with, the amount I was able to sell it off for was insane.
- Akai MPC Live - I was rocking an MPC X, and had the Live... and didn't really need both. The X was a serious upgrade from the Live... both from the amount of quick buttons, but also the 16 Q-Links is just great. I didn't really need the Live anymore.

Which currently leaves me with just the Moog Murf for sale. I have great memories tearing up loops with it, and will miss it when it goes, but it's another one sitting in a box, just waiting to go out the door.

I have to say, not having so much around to maintain and think about is nice. Even with what I have left sometimes it feels like a burden to just keep it working. I'll probably be selling off, donating, or otherwise getting rid of a few more things, but I also do feel like I am settling into what my core studio ought to be now. Once my last big piece of furniture comes in I'll have to take a picture and start writing up more about what I am doing with it, what decisions and trade offs I've made, and figure out which few more pieces of gear go out the door.
