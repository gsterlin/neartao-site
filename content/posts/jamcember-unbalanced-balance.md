Day 3... still at it :D

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/unbalanced-balance

This started as a four bar loop about two or three weeks ago on my Akai MPC Live mk2, and I just left the main loop running for like an hour and didn't get sick of it. The drums were all on the same track and I did need to separate those out, but beyond that I had a good enough mind to keep the bass, wurli, and sitar sounds on their own tracks, so it wasn't overwhelming to dig in and actually start making different sections of the song.

Since it did not take too much time to wrangle this together, I also took the time to bring it into the Yorgos Arabatzis Mastering 2.0 project. I had found I had mixed everything \*way\* too low, and wanted to see how the YA Mastering would help out. I'm pleasantly surprised with how well by default the settings were able to pull the mix up by the boot straps and get it into a bit more of a reasonable to publish grade.
