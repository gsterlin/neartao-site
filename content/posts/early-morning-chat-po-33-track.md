Although I've been happily selling off gear, I've still got the Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators I picked up a while back. I was feeling like putting something together super fast, and while I was planning on recording off samples, creating drum programs, all that fun stuff... I also didn't want to spend too much time.

So... I reached for my trusty PO-33 and decided to sample in some beats. Originally I was going to use the internal microphone, but while this is sometimes interesting, there was a bit too much background noise (ie, the kid wouldn't stop singing Frozen songs). I had to use the line in, which honestly does tend to have a fuller sound, the microphone is fine, but often it does lack the bottom end a bit.

At any rate, I ended up using four samples, one for the instrument, two drum tracks, and the vocal. I know some folks really like to get their chops perfect, and while there is a place for that, I also love me some dirty chops. What this means is, I was super lazy, and let the less than ideal chopping feature of the PO-33 do its magic, or butchering, depending on how you feel about it. Sure, I could have trimmed things, but who has time for that!

I had been planning on doing a few more fancy filters through my pedal board, but it didn't really feel necessary. Honestly, the PO-33 does have some pretty functional effects, and you can hear them on the track. If I get some more time, I'll pretty it all up, but here is the track in all its glory, warts and all!

I've also backed up the PO-33, so if you're interested in playing around with it:
