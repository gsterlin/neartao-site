Well I rushed my [MPC Forums](https://www.mpc-forums.com) beat battle submission, and ended up deciding to post a track to [STBB Forever](https://stbbforever.com/index.php) this time. Not sure that I'll dive deep into the STBB community and beat battles or not, but it's fun to find some other communities and see what may or may not stick with you.

For the [STBB #693](https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=674) track, there was a \*lot\* of content to parse through, and there was a lot that would absolutely trip up on a submission to YouTube or Soundcloud. So, who knows how long my submission will last, but it is posted for now. The rules were pretty simple, use something from every track, no snares on 2 or 4, and something about being able to used instruments, but no sampled melodic content. I decided to just use all of the content just from the tracks, that's been most of my style lately, and it makes it more of a fun challenge to see what you can squeeze out.

Well, I listened to almost all of the content, and just scrubbed through it while I sat outside and enjoyed the breeze. I found a handful of sounds that inspired me, so I cut exported them into some samples for future processing. I think I grabbed fourteen samples total, really all just one shots, and the sound I used as a crash got EQ'd into both an open and closed high hat. Honestly, nothing really tricky going on.

Some of the other samples I grabbed however, were just too noisy, and needed some taming through low pass and high pass filters, and some judicious use of effects. One sound in particular I gave some delay, reverb, and gating treatment to make it more synth pop'ish. I spent a little time trying to mix the levels of clips, but honestly not enough to really balance and polish things up. I was really trying to hit a two hour time max, so it didn't really leave much time from the start to get to arrangements.

If I am being honest with myself, this has been a big downfall for my BB submissions, and maybe I should just commit to spending more time, but I still hold out hope I can streamline my process to get faster.

Anyway, once I had a bunch of different samples looping over some four bar tracks, I figured it was time to start making different sequences on the MPC, which I did, to epic failure, which consumed a lot of time. Instead of doing Track Mutes, I accidentally did a whole bunch of sequences with Pad Mutes... which follow sequences. I know this, I know this, I know this... but it just completely passed my mind.

So... I had to redo all the work, by breaking up my single track into multiple tracks. Yeah... it soaked up precious time I could have used in other places, but now lost probably 15 minutes breaking the one track into several tracks. Before you suggest I use the explode function, which I absolutely could have, I did it by hand, this was my punishment for making this mistake. I do need to break myself of the habit I have fallen back into for not just recording everything on separate tracks. Plus to be fair, a good amount of time was spent just renaming things so I could find may way around faster afterwards.

From here, I was able to flip to different sequence sections, and name them appropriately so that I could put something together in song mode. What you hear below is what I was able to put together in roughly fifteen to twenty minutes of arrangement time. There are a few sections I'd like to tweak, but honestly it's the mixing that would have offered more improvement, followed by at least one pass to give it some mastering spin.
