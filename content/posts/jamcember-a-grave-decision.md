Was struggling to pull anything together for day 26. I started a bunch of tracks but nothing really grabbed me. Must be a downer from all the excitement from Christmas. \*shrug\*

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/a-grave-decision

I felt like I was just pulling things together randomly... and then when I'd start to track out different sections nothing felt like it felt like it worked together. Heck, I removed half of this track because it just didn't sit in place correctly and the transitions were quite jarring. It is possible that I am just getting tired of making a track a day, but I think it's just the mood.

Instead of wimping out for the month and leaving a gap, I figured I would just hobble something together. The track certainly feels okay, but just not a lot going on with it. Maybe it is just a transitional piece which is fine, but at this point it's just a bit underwhelming for me.

Plus... I just got home from a two hour drive, so it doesn't help that I feel kind of tired and don't want to think about music any more right now.
