I've had this audio sitting on my OP-1 for a while (okay two weeks), and while I'd like to have sampled and chopped it up some, I figured I'd send it out into the universe. I had sent the loops over to my father and brother in-law to see if either of them wanted to try and play some guitar over it. Unfortunately that didn't happen. Maybe they were too intimidated, I mean this is super awesome! If you're interested in playing around with or adding something to this track, I'd love to hear it, so link something in the comments!

For those who are curious, this was created by playing a couple of sounds from Reason, I wanted to check out some piano sounds and effects, as well as the Humana Vocal Ensemble. I played the two different tracks at different speeds, and ultimately ended up slowing the OP-1 tracks down six semitones. Running at 1:1 speed it's a bit too chipper, but I still find this track to sound uplifting and fun.

I think there something interesting that can be done on the PO-33, so don't be surprised if you hear this coming up in another song in the future!
