So Pattern Mode and the related topics are more or less done now.

Well, between continuing writing up the guide, and making videos, I guess it's out there and seems to be helping people out. I've been getting a bit of folks posting here or there. If you've written me a message someplace and I haven't responded I promise I am not ignoring you, I'm just ignoring the forums so I can make sure I have time to write and record as my primary focus. I am trying to get around to catching up on the various forums once a week or so. Thanks to those of you have reached out though, it means a lot and I am glad I could help.

I still need to figure out how I want to reference the videos and other material in the guide, I was planning on doing it today, but I just kind of took an energy dive and figured it can wait until later in the week. I did get two more sets of sessions of videos recorded though, so at least twelve more days of content to upload, and Session 2 is finally out there, with Session 3 already on deck. Right now my focus is on getting enough content for the videos uploaded so that I can happily take a long weekend with my wife up in Vermont in a few weeks... should be fun!
