This track is done from the [STBB Forever #699](https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=734) Beat Battle. I used the tracks provided, as well as a track that I did years ago to jam these tracks together. It is not a great track, and more just playing around. The rules were to use the provided samples, a beep, vocal or bleep track or whatever, and you could use outside sounds.

I don't know why I had the idea to do a beat and then transition into a DnB/Jungle type of track... but I did it. Results were not so great though. It leaves for an awkward transition, and the second half only really hits the rules because I had a computerized vocal "beep" sound in it. So, uhm... I guess points for "creativity" maybe? But for actual execution this is kind of hot garbage.

I almost did not post the track because I'm not really happy with what I did with it or what it could have become, but somebody needs to set the low bar, and I'm pretty sure I did that this week, especially after going through a lot of the other entries. Some folks put together some seriously good tracks, which is great!
