Just something a little jazzy, a little funky...

https://youtu.be/hY7RDyr6lPA

The track started out life back in August at my sister's house while visiting, and was a subset of a jam session that I did with my brother in law. Sadly, no guitar or other instrument takes were had, so I had to add in some electric piano, pads, and bells to fill the track out a bit, and give it a bit of a jazzier feel.

On listening to it again, I probably should have gone back and redone the baseline, but \*shrug\*... I'm about to be throwing a birthday party. So this turned into about a 30 minute special. We create what we can with the time we are allotted in this life :D.
