Another experiment, and trying to wrap up the Audio Input/Audio Export sections

[neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.11](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.11.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.11.pdf)

I've got some ideas for linking some working session videos with the guide, so stay tuned for that.

The last two days were mostly about trying to flesh out some of the existing sections some more. Primarily the audio input section, but that also drove me to adding a new section for audio output as well. I'm nearly done with these, and should be able to get into more detail for getting into sampling and adjusting samples soon.

Feedback from folks has been to keep up with how I am writing. I know my style is kind of loose, but I guess it is helping people understand what different sections do. I'll keep at it for now, unless I get specific feedback to try and go a different direction.

Thanks!
