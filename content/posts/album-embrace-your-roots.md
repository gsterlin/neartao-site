This here is the fourth album I put together, and it is steeped in Ableton Live... Live 2.0 and beyond I believe. I'd have to go back and look... if I could even find the old project files... woof. Most of this is just taking loop libraries, sometimes chopping them, but probably mostly just placing the loops on the timeline and mixing the volume levels. I had been reading a lot about Ableton at the time and it was getting a lot of hype. Note: I still miss the old warping method... \*sigh\*

Heck I probably wasn't even sure how to use envelopes and filters properly. For me this was just getting my feet wet still, hanging out at the local music store, and sharing tracks we all put on our mix CDs. Sure it was dorky, but it was also a whole lot of fun!

There are a handful of tracks on here that have some Triton Studio sounds... because I rapidly got bit by the music bug and wanted to get into instruments. Mostly the sounds are stock patches played with the Triton's arpeggiator which is still a pretty fun tool to mess around with.
