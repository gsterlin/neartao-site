Well this was a super quick flip of the [MPC Forums BB #284](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=199354&p=1800618#p1800618), and when I say quick I mean I did this in about 30 minutes. This was entirely an exercise to force myself to get it completed, since I am kind of running out of time, and I wanted to see where I could go if I just unrealistically restricted myself. My primary goal was to make sure that I wanted to limit the number of takes I did to put this together, and figure out how to glue it together in a way that it would sound coherent.

My first stop was to find a four bar section that looped well enough that I could chop it up into something useful. Once I isolated the loop, I moved to chopping, I was hoping that using regions I could get it pretty close, but there was a few hits that were pretty off beat, and a bit of swing thrown in for good measure. So post creating regions, I needed to go through and adjust end points. Honestly, this isn't so bad on the MPC Live mk2, and I was able to get it where I wanted it. Once I set the tempo, I spent some time listening to the chops at different semitones, and decided to go with a straight up -6 semitone drop, and I liked the character I was getting out of it.

From there it was a matter of finding some drums, bass, and fx that sounded decent enough with the track, and that I could live with putting down given my time constraints. From here I knocked out a few four bar drum and bass (not drum n' bass) tracks, and then made them into a 32 bar long sequence. From here I just got to work dropping in the sample chops until I was happy with the sounds... which I was, but I figured some use of delay, feedback, and reverb would help glue the sound together and make it sound a bit more chilled out.

The finishing touches really were just trying to drop in a few one shot hits, deciding on a couple of key insert effects, and then just exporting the content out to a file to upload to soundcloud. See, nothing to it? Is this my favorite track, no, but seriously, it's given me some thought to spending so much time grumbling over minutia so often. Perhaps I should take more effort to move on, and not get so lost in the little details. We'll see :D
