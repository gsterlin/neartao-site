This track started while I was out visiting my sister and her family last week. Was just sitting on a chair and knocking out some sounds to see what would stick.

The picture is from a library, the venting looked interesting so a snapped a picture. Ran it through a Ps Camera filter (elements?) just to see how it would look.

This track is a mix of loops I grabbed, and loading up some synths and using pad performer to try and get some other sounds in tune with the loops I was grabbing. Not rocket science, but the way that the loops were reported as a key in the MPC Sample Edit section made it a bit awkward to figure a few things out. Mostly because the MPC refuses to acknowledge flats, so it always thinks everything is sharp. Not a big deal per se, but it can mean that you've got to think through what key/note range it thinks content is in and then break it down into what you are actually going to play. Sure if you do it right it all matches up regardless if you are sharp or flat, but it can mean that the way you think about some of the notes is just off, if that makes sense?

I'm forgetting a lot about what I did last week for putting this together, other than I was planning on jamming with my brother in law, but he was busy so I just decided to add more elements and try and finish the track off myself.

Which leads me to today, where I was going through the various projects I messed around with last week, landed on this one first, and decided to load it up. Considering that Yorgos' mastering suite 2.0.2 just dropped yesterday, I figured I'd build up a sequence, go through track mutes, and then drop it into the good 'ole YAM. Gotta say, it came out shiny, but just like my other track, did require a bit of love to filter out some of the high end. I don't remember doing this so much with 2.0.1, but perhaps it is just the samples I have been working with. At any rate, fixing those issues up is definitely something I feel like I need to take care of, and not necessarily blame on the
