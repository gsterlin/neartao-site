Just posted a video up on some of the things I've done over the last few weeks to experiment with getting the new MPC line to talk with Eurorack and get everything in sync. It's nothing to fancy or special, but felt like this might be useful for others who are trying to figure out how to do something similar.

If there is interest, I'll work on putting another post together to outline the details more fully, but this just seemed like a good place to start.
