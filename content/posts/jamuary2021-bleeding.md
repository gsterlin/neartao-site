Day 22... and this is a very noisy DnB track... so considered yourself warned...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/bleeding

The pictures is of a family friend's dog, that just looked super evil for the day. I might have to play with the picture again, because it could really turn into something special. Not today though... because it's just about time to start preparing for tomorrow!

This track is just a straight up noisy DnB track... I initially wasn't intending to get so gritty but everything just kind of fell into place that way. I had a ton more FX I had layered in, but had a bit of a hard time figuring out if you can automate turning FX on and off (turns out as far as I can tell you cannot).

So with that out of the way, I just started to lay down a Main and an Alt track... mostly to have a "full intensity" and "half intensity" layer for the tracks to do track mutes between. I was hoping to use the track mute groups to work the way mute groups do... but instead of turning one off and one on... it turns everything in the same group on... uhm... not really what I wanted... I gave up on that avenue as well, and decided I would go eagle clawing for turning groups on and off. My hand posture was a little weird, and I am sure there's a better way to do this (i.e. probably record everything off to clips... muhahaha), but I just went through the brute force method for today.

Nothing special here really other than the things I tried to work out anew, but since they didn't pan out I guess it is not so special.
