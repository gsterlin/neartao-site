Hey folks, guess it's been nearly three months since I last updated the guide. Yikes!

[NearTao's SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.24](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.24.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.24.pdf)

This is my first pass at trying to get the firmware 2.0 changes wrapped around my head. I know I missed a few section updates, mostly in the settings area, and I am sure there are some shortcuts I need to wrap around to getting added into the guide, but by and large I do feel like I understand it pretty well now.

And what an update this is. It hasn't completely blown my socks off, but the volume of workflow improvements, additions to the sequencer mode like step recording, zero point cross sample editing, simultaneous edit improvements, new effects, more skip back buffer... I mean this is much more than I think anybody was expecting, and on top of it there's DJ Mode changes, and even just little fun changes like 404 vs 303 reverse playback styles. My hat is off to you Roland, you've done good. Most impressive to me is that I'm not seeing any obnoxious bugs yet either.

The trip to Brazil was fun, I managed to get a lot of beach time in without getting a sunburn, and I ate a lot of local food without gaining a substantial amount of weight. Now that I'm back home though, I am trying to get my life back in order, and get back to some habits.

Anyways, hope you all enjoy and have a great day!
