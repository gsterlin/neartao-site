Something that I was working on last month, and dug up to make sure it got completed...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/flexing

The picture is from the zoo we visited in Hawaii.

The track itself I worked on while visiting my sister and came about from trying to prep some content for jamming with my brother in law. We got a couple good jam sessions in, but nothing recorded. This particular track was something that I was just up in the morning messing with and had saved off for a while and figured it was something worth saving to work on and finishing later. Up at 6am this morning, got a long day ahead, and figured it was as good a time as any to run it across the finish line!
