Most of this update was filling in the Sample section to the best of my abilities within my time constraints.

[NearTao's SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.13](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.13.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.13.pdf)

There's some things that I thought I understood about sampling on the mk2, that I'm clearly going to have to go back to. I also skipped on the Skip Back section, because honestly, I think it deserves it's own heading/section as it is quite distinct (though related) to sampling, and has some interesting workflow implications.

Thanks!
