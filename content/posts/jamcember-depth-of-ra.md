The ninth day of December has yielded the ninth track of the month.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/depth-of-ra

This track was put together using only the plugins and fx available from the MPC Live in standalone mode, so no samples, loops, or any other audio content. I wanted to see what I could put together using the new drum machine, electric, tube, and bass plugins to put something together. A few of the tracks I really drizzled on the delay and feedback, and I tossed a gated filter for good measure. So, today was the creation of a totally new beat out of the box, and just seeing where it would take me.

After listening to the track, I suspect I should have spent some more time diving into the individual drum sounds on the multi drum kit I loaded, instead of just shuffling through the multi presents. What I settled on is fine, but I think it could have been a bit bigger to compete with some of the sounds that really pushed the drums backwards. I also suspect that Mother Ducker could have done some work for me to pump the bass, or I needed some eq/filter to make a bit more room for the kicks.

Either way, I'm actually pretty impressed with how much you can do with just the included synths, and I suspect through gratuitous resampling and chopping a person would be able to make some very interesting tracks. At the end, it was fun, and I shall consider using these synths to play around a bit more in the future for sure.
