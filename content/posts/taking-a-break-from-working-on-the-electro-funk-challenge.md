title: Taking a Break from Working on the Electro Funk Challenge

If you want to check out the MPC Forums Challenge... this time we're working on some Electro Funk [here](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=200241). Yeah, I've taken a break from some of the Beat Battles to work on some songs... and so far this is fun, and a good opportunity to dust off gear other than the sampler.

Here's my notes so far.

1) The use of samples is really sparse, and I don't think it's how we'd think of sampling today.  I do get a vibe of a much smaller sample set, where used, in the genre.  I'm hearing some similar sounds here and there... some fx hits or stabs... which I'm not totally sure if these are off of a sample record, or just from a drum machine... but for me it really indicates that there really isn't any complex sampling, pitch shifting, etc... and these are going to sound inauthentic in this genre.  So for me, I'm likely going to avoid straight up sample tricks.

2) Very sparse use of FX... I'm hearing stuff like delay, chorus, reverb, tremolo, vibrato, flanger, phaser... frequently, and used to quite a great effect.  There might be a few others that I am missing, but a lot of this is pretty straight up FX work, and nothing too fancy or in your face, or when it is in your face it is super obvious "hello tremolo".  I've got some guitar pedals I'm going to be using for this duty, but I'm going to likely use them sparingly because a lot of the tracks sound far more raw.

3) Monophonic monsters are on display here.  I mentioned I'm dusting off my Voyager, definitely creating key groups so I can do a bit more complex work without having to track out until it is time, but setting the key group programs to mono so I don't accidentally get carried away.  When going for chords I am looking to detune my Voyager to get 5ths, or I might do some guitar pedal chorus work... we'll see.  It does seem important to the sound though, and honestly, it'll make it easier for me to think about smaller sets of notes to create the sound.

4) I've been noticing a fair mix of what sounds like live drums and/or drum machines.  I've got a four note polyphony drum machine, and I just sampled it raw, got 16 different hits out of it and I set the program to 4 note polyphony.  I may get more into note choking and such... but I am going to stick with what I've got setup so far.  It doesn't seem too far off from the tracks that are drum machine only.  Probably going to have to study them more though, and see if I can pick out any more nuance.

5) Vocals, a lot of cornballery going on here.  Some of it is not, but I'm working on getting some vocoder work on some cheeseball vocals.  A lot of it is just coming out as unabashed fun, and something to stick into your brain.  So, nothing to take too seriously, but can add some really good rhythm and movement to the track.

6) Hearing some guitars and real bass out there... and might give playing something a shot.  However, I am not any good with a guitar or bass... so not sure about it... maybe a handful of chords or something just to see what I can do here.

I will be digging in some more tonight, curious to see what other's are hearing and trying.
