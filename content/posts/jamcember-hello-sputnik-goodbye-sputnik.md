On the twelfth day, there was two

This track was a ton of fun to put together. I wanted to change my perspective on making tracks this month, and decided to focus on chopping up samples, but 100% making my own content. So this project started as a deep dive into Reason Studio 11 to really really really get into some sound design. I knew I wanted to go glitchy and spacey, and I think I pretty well delivered on those themes in this track. So all drum patterns, loops, everything were initially created in a 30 minute session in Reason, and then I bounced and exported six tracks.

From there, I moved over to the MPC, and just started chopping. I didn't exactly know how I wanted to go about it, but I tried to make the cuts as clean as possible, even with some of the loops gliding from one sound to another. It wasn't too technical, but there were a few triplets and rolls that I wasn't sure if I was going to micro edit, or just do some sloppy chops. I ended up doing a little bit of both and figured I would see which chops stuck and which ones dropped.

All told, the track came together really quickly once the chops were done, I had a blast working with the different sounds, practicing how to knock them out, and putting different sections of the track together.

So why are there two tracks? Well a few minutes after dropping Hello Sputnik, Sunbeam42 on Soundcloud dropped a note about cutting out the noise. I figured I had the time so why not just make a Goodbye Sputnik track and see how it went. Personally, I did the whole track around the glitchy noise, and had already dropped it way down in the track. It probably could use some filtering, but what the heck... on the road to doing a track a day, I'm not counting the second track. There's always later to come back to it anyways :D

For now, I'm staying focussed on a track a month, and I'll definitely be getting back to making my own sounds.
