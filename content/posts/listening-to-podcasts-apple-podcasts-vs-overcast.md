title: Listening to Podcasts - Apple Podcasts vs Overcast
url: /2020/08/11/listening-to-podcasts-apple-podcasts-vs-overcast/

I've been listening to podcasts for a number of years now in the iOS environment. I keep going back to Apple Podcasts every major release or new hardware deployment, but it just never sticks for me. The feature set is absolutely fine as it is, and if there were no other options I would probably stick with it.

Apple Podcasts

I upgraded to a new Mac, and have decided to give the Apple Podcasts app another spin. One thing that jumps out immediately is that it is not sync'ing podcasts across my iOS device and my Mac. Perhaps this is a feature that should work, but I would expect like most other Apple apps that this would be pretty simple to setup. There is an option under preferences to sync between devices, but it just doesn't seem to do anything. I suppose I could search for how to do this on the internet, if it is there, it might as well not exist if it is not easy to figure out.

Still, I downloaded a few Podcasts that I listen to into the app, and the interface certainly is pretty easy to search for Podcasts and it is not too complicated to play things. This is something that I could see telling people to use. It does come with any of your Apple devices after all.

On the other hand, I guess I have been spoiled...

Overcast

I have been using Overcast for a few years now, and as a free app, it is what I would expect to be essential to download for anybody who likes to listen to podcasts. Yes it does have ads, but they are quite out of the way and not obtrusive for operation of that application. If you don't like the advertisements, you can get a yearly subscription. The yearly subscription also lets you upload files directly into Overcast, which sounds like a pretty handy feature. I have not subscribed and have not used it, but I can certainly envision using this feature one of these days.

Sync'ing podcasts between iOS and iPad devices has been super easy. As a result of writing this blog post I checked again to see if there is a Mac app for this, and unfortunately there is not. Maybe when we can run iOS or iPad apps on our Mac this will become an moot point, but if you do need to sync between many devices this might be a sticking point.

For me, the best feature of Overcast is the "Smart Speed" setting, which plays audio faster not by speeding it up, but by reducing silence and pauses that are natural part of language. Just with this setting turned on, I am often listening to podcasts at 1.2 to 1.5 times faster. You also have the ability to increase the play speed as well, which can get you an incredible speed increase for playing audio. Personally I am not a fan of listening to the podcast faster than what "Smart Speed" offers because I find it harder to concentrate on, but users have the option to manage several settings to increase or decrease podcast speed at your leisure.

Overcast also includes an option "Voice Boost" which effectively adds some compression to increase the overall volume of the podcast. I find this incredibly helpful in keeping a consistent volume level making it much easier to listen to a podcast and maintain a reasonable volume control.

Conclussion

It is probably no surprise, but I'll be sticking with Overcast for the time being. I suspect that there is little to anything that Apple is going to do for now to improve their podcast app, but I will still keep an eye out for it or any other applications that might be worth trying out.
