As many of you have experienced with social distancing and stay at home orders, it is still hard to keep moving. I am used to getting a lot of movement in from work, but from staying at home I had been finding myself being a bit of a couch potato and just sitting in my chair.

I'm at week two of allowing my Apple Watch to remind me to keep moving. Normally I have been ignoring the "you can do it messages", especially when they come in at 10pm, but the last two weeks I have filled all those silly circles every day. You know what? I think I'm going to make a habit of it. Honestly, it's taken this kind of drastic change in my life to see that I need to take a more active role in my personal health, and I do have more free time because I don't have to drive to work every day.

On the flip side, I don't think that my dogs have been so keen. I am not dragging my oldest down the street, but she's definitely only got two speeds: slow and stopped... It has been a bit of a challenge to go out running, so I'm opting for some slower jogs. It still gets my heart rate up, but it just takes longer to complete the circuit.
