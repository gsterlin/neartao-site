First track for #jamcember and trying to do a track a day.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/my-peaceful-day

Just a lofi track to relax to. Yeah I know it's kind of noisy... as the lofi folks like? A lot of vinyl, tape, and other random clicks and clacks. All done on the MPC Live mk2. I'll probably keep all of the tracks done through the MPC Live mk2 this month just to really dig into it a bit more and see if 2.9 has either weird workflow bugs I trip over or things that get me to think about working on the tracks differently inside the box.

I also ran this through the YA Mastering 2.0 that just came out. Definitely used up a lot more of the available sound space, though I think I probably needed to tame the high end a bit more. That's totally my fault for not investigating, but it sounded okay on my headphones and off of the mk2 speakers... but playing it on a few other devices it is a bit... uhm... much on the high end. Normally I'd fix it... but I mean business for trying to do a track a day, and need to get to it.
