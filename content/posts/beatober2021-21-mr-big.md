Yeah! Finally getting a vision of some sounds/ideas to put together into a big ol' mix and mash of tracks.

https://youtu.be/G7u\_6dGFtv4

I have been so focussed on trying to just get a track done, or only having a half hour that I kind of just forgot about my original goal of putting a set of tracks together. I certainly played around with it a lot, a month or two ago, but I have been more focussing on just doing a track a day for the last couple of months that it passed.

Today I happened to have some time, and decided to really knuckle down to get the MPC Live setup to send signals to the eurorack, and I am so glad I did. I've now got a system for sending drum patterns that to both MPC programs and CVs, and it really works. Super excited about this progress. I'll find some time to write up what I did, because if anyone else is trying to do this, it isn't exactly straight forward. Plus, now that I know it works it's giving me ideas of how to move forward for more tracks.

So for now, stay tuned, but hope you enjoy the show!
