I did a thing

https://youtu.be/3P5SMy9Ul-w

Well the track didn't use the eurorack for much, but I did a bit of processing through it before recording a bunch of audio into the SPs, then chopping that content up on the MPC to actually play it. Given all the noise it became a bit of a hassle to prepare all of the samples on the MPC because it just couldn't find the start/end with threshold very well, but it felt like it was worth the effort.
