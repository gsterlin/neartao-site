Okay... today felt pretty good... but did like... five... maybe six takes... was getting a bit of a jam going and then would make a mistake... this take came together pretty well though.

This is my pretty traditional setup I've been going for lately, but with the SP 202 and SP 303 added to the end of the chain... oh and I've added in the Zoom H6 at the end of chain to function a bit as a mixer/audio router... the RCA to 1/4" adaptors are what is causing me the biggest headache in this setup... but it is kind of nice having the 202 do LPF duties at the end of the chain, and then the Vinyl FX from the 303 to do some compression and wow/flutter duties... and a hint of vinyl noise.
