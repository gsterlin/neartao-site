The day kicked my butt so far... so wasn't really full of energy to put something together. Well that's not quite right... I recorded off a start, and then put the last component of my eurorack case "Tape Grain Glitch"... so getting stuff done, but just really feeling tired today.

You probably wouldn't be surprised to learn that the picture is just a stylized/filtered photo of the blanket my dogs like to sleep on. It is plaid, and they love it.

The track here is actually pretty simple, just a sustained note playing on Morphagene, and the varispeed is being modulated by the Mimetic Digitalis. This is then routed into Sqwk Dirty for some filtering to get the sound to move a little bit, and then into the Mimeophon for some nicely modulated delay and reverb.

But I said it's a sustained noise in the Morphagene, and it's sounding like an attack is applied... well... well... well... I hooked the 0chd to the Sound on Sound input of the Morphagene to give it that hard tremolo kind of sound... so not an envelope per se, but it's kind of doing that kind of duty here.

Oh, and there's a touch of Data Bender mixd in just to give it that high end touch of noise on a different channel on the STMIX.

At any rate... it was just a rather short experiment, and I'll certainly be getting back to mixing the MPC and the eurorack soon, but I just wanted to get a little something going.
