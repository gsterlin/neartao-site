[Apple apologizes to Wordpress, no longer requires free app to add purchases](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/apple-apologizes-to-wordpress-no-longer-requires-free-app-to-add-purchases/)

When I read last week that Apple was removing the Wordpress app from the Apple store I thought things were getting a little strange. The application never had payments in place, and you had to go to the Wordpress site to pay for your subscription. I suspect that given everything going on with Epic and the Fortnight fiasco that Apple is just getting overly sensitive about companies removing their ability to get a 30% cut.

At a high level I get it, creating an online store, payment processing, and all that is expensive. These big companies need to protect their base or risk somebody coming in and taking their lunch, but on the other hand Apple is one (of many) companies that seem to be taking more than their fair share of the value.

I digress though, Apple has backed down from their removal of Wordpress, and has reinstated the application. Interesting times for Apple iOS developers to keep a pulse on for sure.

[480%+, why is Nintendo worried?](https://seanmalstrom.wordpress.com/2020/08/24/if-nintendo-sales-are-480-why-is-nintendo-worried/)

During my MBA study I did a lot of research on Nintendo, and I’ve tried to keep up with where Sean Malstrom is thinking the Nintendo direction is going. It does look like troubling times for Nintendo as they are stuck between console generations for Sony and Microsoft, and it is unclear what exactly they will be putting out for hardware or software over the next year.

The promise from Nintendo had been by merging the console and handheld line into a single system that we’d get more development on the Switch platform. I think the expectation from consumers was that this would mean more high quality software coming out from Nintendo, but instead we’ve continued to get releases at about the pace of a single system.

Clearly hardware continues to be difficult to develop, but it’s hard to see what the consumer benefits are. Nintendo is allowing many many ports onto the system, but a lot of this is shovel ware, and not really worth the asking price. You can see this because there are just so many sales going on all the time.

Nintendo used to be the platform that stood for quality, but they seem to have switched to a platform of quantity. I know market dynamics have changed over the years, especially as downloadable software has greatly reduced the cost of software delivery to consumers, but I’m just not sure where all this is headed.

I had not been aware of the business term Melt Up before, but I think I can guess at what it means. At any rate, gave it a quick read of the definition of [Melt Up](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/melt-up.asp). I was pretty close. What is scary is all the advice saying “Invest cash now”, but the immediate problem is if you invest now, when should you cash out? The stock market is already legal gambling... but telling people when to buy in but no wise words on when to cash out so they can make a call for themselves is scary. I suspect I’ll be trying to look more into Melt Up over the next few days.

[7 Mistakes Many of Us Are Making With Our Money During the Pandemic](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/save-money/pandemic-mistakes/?aff_id=284)

This article hits a few concerns I have in general, but in particular for things that try and give financial advice. So I'm going to provide opinions as my responses, but please, go find an actual financial advisor for actual financial advice!

1. Not Pocketing $225 for watching the news - I'm sorry, but I am already concerned about how much of my personal data that big companies have about me. Do I really want to invite more of this into my home? This is also an "up to", so how much money can somebody realistically make? It feels super intrusive to me, but I'd love to hear somebody's experience using this. For me though... not going to get into my home.
1. Passing up $500 in Free Stocks - Again, another piece of advice with an "up to" tag associated with it. Do you really want to sign up for a stock platform, especially Robinhood. I am sure people have made money on this platform, but I have read countless articles of users burying themselves in debt because they don't really understand their leverage or risk. I'd be super leery of this app myself, I might check it out, but I already have access to well established stock brokers.
1. Not Setting Aside $1M For Your Family - How many of us are really insurable for a million dollars? Especially for $8 a month... the people being referenced getting it at this rate must be younger. Any place reputable I have gotten insurance from will do a phone screened interview, but for this kind of money they are absolutely going to want to see you in person to do a health assessment.
1. Wasting Hundreds on Homeowners Insurance - It is probably worth shopping around to see if you can get a lower monthly fee for home insurance. There are deals out there, and it is possible Lemonade offers better rates. I'd check things out though, as I've only ever gone with local insurance companies myself.
1. Not Buying a Piece of Amazon, Google or Another Company - I would like to point out that owning stock in a company is different than owning the company. Also, these billionaires made their money building their company from the ground up, buying stocks in an established company is not the same as investing at the ground floor. Sure you can make money in the stock market, but I'd caution that you really need to understand a lot of how the market works before considering investing in it.
1. Wasting Money on Car Insurance - This is another one where I'd say it pays to keep your eyes open and look once in a while. You can get savings by bundling this with your home owners insurance as well. It's always worth calling your current insurance agency, let them know how your habits have changed, and see what they can do to work with you.
1. Paying Your Whole Credit Card Bill - Well I have to absolutely agree with this. I know it is tough times right now, but absolutely spend within your means, credit is absolutely dangerous and can turn into a crazy downhill slide. I'd be super careful of any of these agencies that say they will consolidate your debt for a fee though. I know too many people who have taken this step, only to find out they are paying another company to do nothing but take their money, and then they have more interest and late fees piling up.

Be very, very cautious of what you do with your money!
