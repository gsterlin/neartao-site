Had a long day, day off for my daughter, and some arguments. She's not happy that I wouldn't pay for her to eat at Starbucks, and I'm not happy to be treated as a piggy bank. So put this together to just decompress and relax a bit.

So just used the same setup/patch in the eurorack as yesterday, but I did leave the guitar track (on accident) going straight to the outputs. Honestly, it was probably the right choice, but well... it is what it is :D
