For this track I was trying to think about transitions between sections a bit more, and trying to see how it would come together. I kind of think the higher end synth sound is a bit distracting, and the track would probably be better without it. Maybe a few too many elements?

I am happy with the track feeling a bit more funky though, and trying to add in a few more somewhat random sounds moving in and out feels like a good effect.
