Trigger Warning: About to be looking at our own belly button below.

To add to what Ultros saidâ€¦ for audio it is all about loss, it just depends on where and how you are losing audio information, and if that imparts any objective or subjective characteristics to the sound.

To even start with an audio signal, we have to acknowledge that all sounds are imperfect. From the medium in which the sound originates to the air that carries that sound to the listener. It is all imperfect. There is no perfect piano, voice, guitar, or anything else, because all of these things are undergoing constant change, they age, they go in and out of tune, are exposed to humidity, temperature changes, etc. The air that transmits the signal also undergoes similar changes from pressure, movement, space, mixture with other elements, etc. Even our ears that we use to listen, undergo change as we age, losing the ability to perceive certain frequencies, changing the characteristics of a sound, and weirder, our experiences can even change what or how we listen to sound. For something that should be simple, it rapidly becomes very complicated, and probably impossible to account for all the factors that go into it.

So to some extent, it becomes a question of how many factors can we control of a sound that enable us to recreate a performance as repeatably as possible. To some extent we can control the source of audio, and to some extent we can control the environmental factors, so that playing a digital track will have a more consistent recreation of a performance versus seeing a band play the same set live on different days.
