Well... I figured out to mount my old NAS box, and while it is a treasure trove of media, it is also a big, unsorted mess. It's going to take some time for me to dig through and find albums, artwork, and put it all together.

For the moment I think I have settled on Bandcamp as a target to upload content. It seems to be reasonable service wise compared to soundcloud. I'll keep playing around though. Below is the album, enjoy!
