This is not what I had intended to create... but that seems to be par for the course for trying to do a track a day :D

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/emotional-adjustment

The intent for this track was to put some content together in Reason and then make some create patterns that changed chord structures throughout the song. Started off good, made a bunch of chords, arpeggios, and bass lines to flow in a Bb Minor... chord progression of I-VII-v-ii... resulting in Bbmb7, AbM7, Fm/Ab, Cmb7...

I then loaded it into the MPC to flip, and ended up with two different four bar patterns of I/I/v/v and VII/VII/ii/ii. This was all good to start, until I started trying to track out. Oh my did it sound jarring and horrible. Perhaps I should have stayed with the structure I/VII/v/ii and changed up the patterns there. Honestly, I was trying to make things in my life easier to flip the samples, but I didn't realize my mistake until I had a roughly 60 or 72 bar song sequence put together and then listened to it for real. Ouch... a lot of burnt time.

Honestly, the I/I/v/v (well I/v) works fine and keeps the flow going. I am not into chord theory or anything... so I suspect that I just created a mess that never resolved for the listener. It definitely became quite jarring to listen to and I couldn't release it as it stood. From there, I tried to just keep enough momentum to get some semblance of a track off the ground. This resulted in my removing all of the VII/ii content because the intro and outdo were all in I/v and sounded fine, I had just created this massive mess in the middle. Sadly removing content the way I did was a bit much and the song structure doesn't really hold up as well as I would have liked. I had dumped a lot of time into trying something new out, but just didn't have it in me to put a bow on the track today.

There is something here, but it'll take some time to find it and fix it back into a manageable track. Today you won track, today you won!
