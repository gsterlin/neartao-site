It's so easy to see all kinds of cool gear out there, and wonder how it might impact your sound, followed by a purchase for something that you might not use. I can attest to this, because to even write this post I've clean off a lot of miscellaneous music gear from my desk just so I can have room to type. It has become a frequent habit of mine to pull out instruments and effects to start a project, only to then have too many options. This coming from somebody who's been weaning off of software to get back into more of a hardware focus.

It's not all crazy though, and I have started to sell off more gear over the last couple of years, so I can at least convert unused and unloved gear into reinvestment cash to help me get more out of the second hand gear market.

So what's on the rundown of things to consider offloading?

Well I currently own 3 MPCs, and at least one needs to go, and I say this as I've been putting research into an MPC 4000. Forget that though, I've got an MPC 1000 which has been a staple for me, especially with JJOS. Then I've managed to pick up an Akai MPC Live and an Akai MPC X. I started with the Live and really liked the portability and power in it, but if I'm really being honest, it isn't cutting it for me. It's way too fiddly with buttons to switch q-link functions and it really demands a fair amount of touch screen work. While I liked it, the context switching in the interface was just a bit too much for me. Which is why I picked up the Akai MPC X. I do think the MPC X works well as a center to my studio, but I'm not in love with it. So I'm still digging the MPC 1000 with JJOS, I appreciate the MPC X, and yeah... I'm parting with the MPC Live.

Then there is the drawer stuffed with gear. It's got an Organelle I'd like to use more, but probably just a dream. A few Pocket Operators that I do like, but tend to be used more as one off effects and sounds right now that I sample from, so... really am I getting that much out of them? Then there is the OP-1 and OP-Z, staring at me, wanting to be useful and productive, but I haven't really laid down any tracks with them lately. While I appreciate the constraints in those systems, I also am kind of ignoring them. It's time to dust off some of that mess and pass it along to the next person who can appreciate them in a way that I have not been.

My closet is probably the biggest mess though. I have way too many boxed software releases, and while it is kind of cool and might look neat in a studio, is also... in my closet. Do I really need those boxes? A lot of that software is ancient and doesn't even work anymore. Nobody is going to use it, and it has minimal value since who knows if I can even get updates for most of it. I'll need to have a serious heart to heart with myself about this stuff to decide what I want to do with it.

Right now I'm just seeing what I can do with a smaller set of gear:

- Akai MPC 1000
- Chase Bliss Mood
- Chase Bliss Generation Loss
- Teenage Engineering OP-1

I'll be posting up some programs, loops, and other samples in a bit. Stay tuned.
