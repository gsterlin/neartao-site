So reality is starting to set in as I try and consider all of the content I have ever created, and where the heck it is. Servers are gone, my network addressable storage (NAS) won't mount on my computer. I have a bit of a road in front of me to recover my digital life again. I am not giving up already, but it looks like I may have to face some harsh realities about the time investment I need to put in so I can accomplish what I set out to do.

Deep breaths, and just take notes of what needs to be done.

- Links to message boards, social media, etc...
- Upload music albums
- Upload photo albums
- Curate through old sample libraries
- Figure out what to do with tutorial videos
- Replace all the generic artwork... my goodness is it ever present.

All that, while working on building out a plan to move forward. No buggy.
