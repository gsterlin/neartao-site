Yah... sometimes we just need to simplify!

https://youtu.be/ldJchNxMaWQ

Could've made this into a longer track, but yeah... I think keeping it short and simple definitely kept it moving and interesting. At least I feel like I got more out of it than I would have otherwise trying to layer a ton of sounds in and then having a big mess.

Effectively I made the four tracks on the MPC to begin with, and spent the time making sure I was happy with the eight bars first, pretty similar to what I did yesterday. From there I just starting assigning tracks to different outputs on the MPC, and then driving them through different effects in eurorack, and then, as usual, I chased it with the SP 202 and SP 303 at the tail end to just add the dust, grit, and grunge for the song.

I'm definitely feeling like I'm hitting a bit of a better stride with know how I want to build out tracks, so I suspect my next step will be thinking about how to break this down into separate components and then building up a few different songs I can transition between. Done this before, but I'm starting to think about other ways in which I could do this... first I need to think about how much interest or importance I put into having everything be recordable, or if it is more about routing signals around and making do with what I've got. If that makes any sense.
