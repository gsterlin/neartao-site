The beat battle is active for another couple days, if you're interested check it out at [BB 280](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=198305&start=15). The rules are pretty simple, just use the two samples provided, and no outside content. Also, a 1:30 time cap, so no run on pieces.

The image comes from a picture I took while on a work trip to Bangalore. Which reminds me...

I spent a couple of hours and created a lot of different sequences to play with. Some of the components vibed better than others together. Parts were either too high energy or too low energy, so I ended up taking the components I liked the most and putting them together into something that I felt was as coherent as possible without killing a lot of time on this.

Overall I am just mildly happy with this track. My last few submissions have been fine, but either I need to get more optimized in my workflow, or give myself more time to put these beat battles together. I'm partially thinking I am just getting too complicated in the compositions, and then having to spend time mucking around in areas I am unfamiliar with. I am far more used to producing something from components that I have control over, and working with fully mixed content and chopping it up is not very familiar territory for me.

The biggest difficulty that I had was that I wanted to change up the drum progressions after I had copied the sequence 10 times. I came to realize that in the MPC X, standalone mode doesn't seem to have a way to copy a track to a different sequence. My work around for this was to copy and paste, which created a lot of manual work. This wasn't impossible to work out, but it definitely was far more fiddly than I would have liked for a workflow. Perhaps people don't get hung out with this too much, but it did seem sub optimal to me.

Keep on dropping tracks!
