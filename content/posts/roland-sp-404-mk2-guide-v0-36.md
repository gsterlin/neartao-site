Most importantly (for me at least) is I'm still kicking! For those who have been paying attention, I've been slowly branching out into other instruments on my YouTube channel, and starting to look into things like the Dirtywave M8, Roland P-6, and Ableton Move. There's plenty of cool gear out there, and certainly not enough free time to cover it all. That said, I do try and keep the Guide going as new thoughts come to mind.

For those of you downloading this... I had started a Koala integration section a while ago, but I got distracted. The integration is cool and all, but it feels kind of half baked from my usage of it. There's a lot of features and functionality that overlap between the two, but they both manage to offer enough new that I do think it is cool. Unfortunately for me, and my interest levels, I keep finding oddities in how the two integrate together that make it feel like a nice start, but not a seamless integration. I'll likely get around to adding more to the guide about it, but I'm just warning you, that there are a lot of stubs and placeholders for things I was considering writing about, and not really a whole lot of content about how or why to do things.

You might wonder why release this update at all then? Well I fairly regularly get questions around BPM issues with the SP404 mk2, and that it does act in odd and inconsistent ways. There was a recent conversation over on the Elektronauts SP404 mk2 forum [thread](https://www.elektronauts.com/t/roland-sp-404-mk2-part-2/211287/1419) that I figured it might be worth its own section in the guide. I waffled on how to even format the information, but honestly, I just started typing and came up with what ultimately felt like it was worth an Appendix. Something that stays out of the way of people just learning the device, but a section you can heat when you want to do a deep dive on what in the world is going on with BPM values.

Over the BPM Breakdown section, I tried to go over what the different BPM values are used for, what the priority order of them is from my own testing, and tried to point out any interesting things you might be able to do with effects or other settings. It's certainly not covering everything, but if you do feel that something is missing or could be added to this section feel free to reach out and I'll gladly look into it to see how I might be able to fit it in.

As always, thanks for hanging out, asking questions, and just being a cool bunch of people!
