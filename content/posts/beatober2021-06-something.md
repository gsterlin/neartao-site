And now for something completely different.

{{< youtube uFkvE6DVNqs >}}

Today I just decided to do what I could with the pocket operators I have on hand... PO-32, PO-33, PO-35... and see what would come from it. I'll definitely get back to the MPC Live and Eurorack, but just needed a change of pace for a bit. Probably will do another PO track or two for the time being and go for something a bit longer, I suspect.
