I've been a lot more self reflective lately, and I can definitely understand people getting stuck in their own heads through all of this self isolation. Right now I'm focussed on two things... breaking old habits... and making new habits.

**Breaking Habits  
**

- Caffeine... while it's nice... I don't have time to get out and get energy drinks and soda every day, and I do not want it in the house
- Gaming... was spending a \*lot\* of time just playing video games
- Waiting for **something** to happen... a lot of time was wasted just waiting for somebody else to do stuff with me... now I just say "good to go" and they are either with me or not... no judging...

**Making Habits  
**

- Closing those silly rings on the Apple Watch... I'm not letting this thing linger, and it's a great excuse to get out for a walk
- Hitting the pads on the MPC daily. Was letting some gear collect dust... I don't need to finish anything... but definitely starting way more
- Going for inbox zero... and cleaning up my email every day is helping me keep way more focussed and on the ball

**Other Random Stuff**

- Selling off old and unused stuff... gear included... the maintenance of old PCs and other electronics can just get so overwhelming... I'm done with that
- Making an effort to reach out to friends and family on a weekly basis... making sure everybody is okay and knows that I'm out there for them.

Keep your chin up, and think about how you can make small changes to improve your life!
