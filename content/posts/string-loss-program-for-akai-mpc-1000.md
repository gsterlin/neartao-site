This came as an experiment playing with some string sounds from the OP-1 String engine and and using the Chase Bliss Mood for the effects. I recorded into the granular tape effect, and sent the output through the slip effect, giving the sound quite a level of character. The initial recording is [String Loss](/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/string-loss.wav), and to me it evokes a bit of a cutting and driving sound that exists somewhere between the string and organ family of sounds. It was pretty simple to chop up into a program, which resulted in [String Loss MPC 1k](//neartao.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/string-loss-mpc-1k.zip). At the moment, I've really just been playing with the straight chops at different velocities, but I think for the song I'm building up I'm going to lean into some pitch shifting of the parts to see how I can really push the sounds.
