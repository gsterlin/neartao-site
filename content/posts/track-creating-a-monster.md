It has been nice to have a few days off from making a track a day, to be able to think a bit more about what I've learned and putting a track together. I still want to do a month two lessons learned for #jamuary2021... maybe tomorrow I'll pull my thoughts together?

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/creating-a-monster

The picture is from a long time ago, my daughter and I were under a blanket with a flashlight trying to make scary faces. Good times, and nobody got scared. She was a fun kid. I was trying to figure out a good place to use the picture, and this one seemed to be a good fit.

As far as the track itself goes, well it started as a an idea to maybe try and start putting together drum kits and key groups together under a Patreon account. I'm tossing around the idea of posting content under the Creative Commons, but have not really committed to it yet. I think I need to put at least a short business plan together so that I can really understand what I am trying to do and getting out of it.

The samples came together pretty quickly themselves, and I spent some time setting appropriate loop points, working out how to get the appropriate envelopes, filters, and fx for each sound. Nothing too serious, but it was a bit of work. From there I through the drum kit through a few effects to keep it rolling, but not too out of control. I kind of think I went too over the top, but it can be hard to tell when you're working with your own content. I have tried a listen through a few different speakers though, and so far nothing embarrassing has popped out... I don't think I nailed the mix, but I'm pretty happy with it.
