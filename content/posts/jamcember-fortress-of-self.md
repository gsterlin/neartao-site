Mixing it up a bit for the twenty second track

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/fortress-of-self

The picture comes courtesy of a trip to Munich. Not so much a tourist type of city, but there's a lot to see there. I think that particular shot came from a train ride that I took with my family to go check out the Olympic Stadium out there. It was interesting to see, but kind of sad at the same time to see something that had so much funding and investment put into it that ended up not being kept up and maintained as much as you'd hope. I suspect that a lot of the Olympic areas around the world are like this, and I suppose when things get back to normal I will have to travel around to check out more for myself.

I am not suggesting that working in Reason Studio and then dropping loops was becoming a rut for making tracks, but doing it every day was getting repetitive. Go to work... sit in front of the computer... then flip to Reason Studio... sitting in front of the computer. Today I just needed to go for sound design someplace else.

To get this track really rocking I spent a lot of time just working on sound design in the Akai S950, and running the output through some Chase Bliss Audio guitar pedals. In particular I spent a lot of time for each program messing with Condor to tweak the EQ a bit, then trying various settings in Warped Vinyl as well as Generation Loss. I'll admit, I also got lost spectacularly playing around with Blooper and Mood, but nothing I recorded and sampled really stuck today. There was some really great ambient sounds and glitched out loops to be had for sure, but I wouldn't say it was inspiring me for what I was looking to put together for this track. I made my choice and decided to move on.

I also wanted to go for more of an older school style track similar to what I used to throw together. Get a sound I liked, lean into it to the extreme, and just build around it into this (often obnoxiously so) long DJ style track. Something you could beat match to and just juggle between a few tracks. The result is that those old beat up Orchestral Strings from the S950 and abused through the Generation Loss probably outstay their welcome, but isn't that half the point of a good old time track. Anyway... I probably won't be dropping more long tracks for a while, but I suppose that there is more time through the month to kill, another nine tracks? So who knows!
