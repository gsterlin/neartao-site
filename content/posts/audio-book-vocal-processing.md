My sister has released the book [SOMNIUM Beyond the Darkness](https://www.amazon.com/SOMNIUM-Beyond-Darkness-D-Sterling-ebook/dp/B087T5TVSS#ace-g1639449406) on Amazon as a kindle book and as a paperback book, which is an excellent read for young adults and adults alike. She's been looking to expand out into the audio book space, which makes sense to me!

She had been looking into some voice actors who could read the book. When I heard the audio quality of the demo, it was rather poor. We were hoping that it was just a quick demo, but it suffered from a lot of background noise. My sister passed on links to the voice actor, and the demo's she had on her website were great. After I gave my sister a few questions to ask and suggestions for contract negotiations, unfortunately it fell through. We suspect that the voice actor recorded her website demo at a professional studio, and likely recorded the demo she produced for my sister at home. Total bummer, but it's better to both live and learn, and get through these miss steps early is what I always say.

This lead somewhat naturally into a conversation with my sister about how she could do this recording work herself. I warned her that the deeper you dig, the more picky you get, and that it can turn into a budgetary sinkhole, but so far she's been digging into figuring out how to get this going herself.

She pretty quickly knocked out the reading of her first chapter, and did it on her Apple Headphones, and honestly, I was shocked at how decent the audio quality sounded, especially since she has had little to no experience in voice recording, and honestly I always thought the Apple headphones were okay at best. I ended up helping her out with some additional de-essing, eq'ing, compression, and reverb for some post treatment, and at first she seemed pretty happy. (Un)Fortunately she listened to her audio tracks, and compared them to what she heard other amateur audio book recordings sounded like. She pretty much immediately picked out a lot of qualities she didn't like in these other amateur recordings, and then quickly realized she had a lot of the same problems in her recording.

This put her back to the drawing board, and I ended up discussing with her about microphones, recording technology, audio processing technology, as well as vocal speaking and positioning techniques. Do not misconstrue and of this that I know what I am talking about, I just know enough to be dangerous, and at least get her into the top rung of the amateur level, but I doubt I'd be able to compete very well even at the bottom of the professional level.

From here, she decided to pick up a Blue microphone. I am pretty sure she picked up the [Blue Yeti](http://Blue Microphones Yeti Studio Blackout USB Condenser Microphone), though I'll have to ask her to be sure. Likely because this was the easiest way for her to hook it up to the computer without having to go through the hassle of using a pre-amp, converting the line audio to a digital format that the computer can understand. I am absolutely guessing here though. Once she got a few tracks recorded, she reached out to talk to me about whether her breaths were too heavy. They were very noticeable! Not super loud, but as anybody who's done vocal recording knows, the closer you are to the microphone to get a good audio level and presence, the louder all your mouth sounds such as plosives are. She was using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) to process her vocals, and I think she spent some time removing the breathing and mouth sounds by hand. If you've ever done this before, you know how much work **that** is!

So oops... but we ended up talking about de breather plugins, and she was definitely interested in the [Waves Debreath](https://www.waves.com/plugins/debreath#removing-vocal-breaths-with-debreath). I looked into the description with her, and it sounded like what it said "on the tin" as it were is what she was looking for. Fortunately this plugin worked for her in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) to do the vocal processing without having to deal with any further hassle.

She doesn't have a lot of the software or hardware I have, so she's been asking me to put together some audio processing chains together. I have some hardware compressors I was thinking of using, but honestly I just used the chain I put together in [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/), and reprocessed it. My sister was asking how it was going for me, and I told her the most time consuming part for me was just visually adjusting the audio levels for the clip, to which she decided to record her microphone at a higher level. This made the compressor work better without having to normalize the clip, and seems to have had no negative side effect on the noise floor post processing.

One thing we played around with was the reverb, and I had been using about 9% wet, but this was too much for her taste. I dropped it down to 6%, and she felt it was still too much. We've settled on about 3% wet reverb, which is just enough to add some presence to the audio, but you hardly hear the difference.

I'll keep some updates going in the future for how things progress, but for now my sister is happy with the process, the amount of work, and the overall quality of the output.

If you're interested in the signal chain, feel free to ask. I may take some time in the future to write it up a bit more and possibly provide the project file that I have put together.
