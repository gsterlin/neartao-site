Ooo... this is bad... like... probably the worst thing I threw against the wall...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/what-the

The picture is a sunrise from the other day while I was on my way to take the dogs out for a walk. It is absolutely the best thing about this track.

So what happened? Well... I wanted to try to do some production on a different machine... and figured I'd dig up my MPC 500. You know... the one I have only goofed around with once in a while over the last few years, so pretty much forgot how to do everything on it that I wanted.

Queue me just experimenting, trying to figure out why the headphone volume is so low, why the pads aren't very response... you know... a lot of things not focussed on making music. Wouldn't be a problem if I was not trying to make a track a day, but instead turned into a giant distraction. One that, if I'm being honest I probably needed... because doing a track a day is kind of intense, even if you're cutting corners to get things completed.

So... this left me with sampling off of a few different devices to get some audio, between PO-32, Reason, and a few other sources, and I was getting pretty happy with how things were coming. From here I was trying to remember how to extend a sequence from 2 bars to a 4 bar or 8 bar loop... and then how to copy tracks, explode notes, whatever... and just remembered that I used to have the muscle memory for the MPC 500, but have definitely lost it.

I certainly had fun... but wasn't sure what to make of a 4 bar loop. I didn't want to sample it all back into the Live because I didn't have time, and I didn't want to brute force my way to something bad. So I just tried to kick start/stop a few sections, and boy was that brutal... Play Start on the MPC 500 does not work the way it does on other MPCs as I remember. But... I was committed to delivering something. I told myself no matter how good or bad, I was going to post a track a day... and boy is this a doozy.

When the dust settles, I probably deserve it to myself to come back to this and see if I want to mess around with the MPC 500 again. I was enjoying myself... and for how tiny it is... well you can do a lot of cool stuff, but... boy not remembering everything took my hamstring out from me :D
