I just got kind of into the dark vibe of the sounds after pitching things down. I suspect the vocals are take it or leave it... and I definitely could have cleaned them up a bit. I guess it could come across as some mumbling or something, but that wasn't my intent. I also think the clickers are a bit too loud and probably could have used some filtering. Ah well... this was another quick one to pull together. It feels looser because of it, but there is something for me here to just keep knocking these things out quickly instead of getting so stuck in my head making the tracks, especially for BBs.
