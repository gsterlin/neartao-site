Some house music... recorded some of the jam off to the Wav Recorder... and some of it made it to the YouTube video.

The picture is just a quick doodle that I did on my iPad. Just done in ProCreate.... just now... while thinking about what to do with this track.

Here's the YouTube video.

{{< youtube JTZKFYO1Bwg >}}

So a few notes here... I am routing all of my output on the MPC out either 3/4 or 5/6, and into the Eurorack, and then processing everything through a couple different chains including Morphagene, Mimeophon, Beads, Sqwk Dirty, and Data Bender, and then going out to the ST Mix.

Part of the recording on Soundcloud does sound a little weird, because... well because a couple of the tracks were output to L/R (or 1/2 if you prefer) while I was trying some of the sounds out and seeing what I wanted to record for the video. I actually clipped out most of this, but I figured I'd leave some of the early stuff in, because you never know what you might want to go back to. Especially when a lot of the way I'm making tracks with the Eurorack are rather ephemeral, so I guess I just "always record" in case I have a track I want to go back to and try and at least chop and rearrange a little bit, when the context of what I put together.

So lessons learned? First, this was pretty fun, and I'll need to think around this a bit more. I basically just created 3 different tracks with different programs, and then used track mute/pad mute to transition through different 2 bar sections. Nothing fancy, but it was pretty fun and a quick way to get something off the ground through the Eurorack filters. What I would definitely change though is that I confused the heck out of myself with how I setup the stereo tracks on the ST Mix, there was no real reason for the order of anything, which made me have to look at the cables a few times and figure out what was going to what. Clearly a bit more presence of mind and clarity around this will help out.

Stay tuned... need to do one more track to finish off the month!
