According to the health app, I now have a 38 day streak of exercise! Two weeks ago I was complaining about just feeling sore everywhere, and now I feel sore in just a few muscles when I push myself for walks. And walk I have, I am still managing 2-3 miles on average a day, and I feel great. Getting through the spring allergy season is always brutal for me, but I made it through the worst of my allergies. Go me!

So I'm getting my walking time down, I'd say that I am hitting about a 16 minute mile (in sandals even), which is not great... but I was around an 18 to 20 minute mile when I started. I could absolutely hit a 16 minute mile before, but I was just being kind of slow. Now I am sure that I can get my walking time down a bit more without too much effort and will see what I can do.

Weight wise, I'm a little sad that with adding the exercise I haven't dropped any weight really, though this wasn't really a primary goal when I started to get myself exercising more. I have been far more focussed on just establishing the habits for getting outside more often and doing any kind of physical activity, and for that I have certainly been successful.

A bonus of all this walking is that I feel like I am able to breath a lot more comfortably, and I guess I have been keeping myself inside intentionally without realizing it. I have very fair skin and I sunburn super easy, but I have been making sure to keep a hat on and don't go outside for too long. Plus, drinking water has been critical to ensuring that I stay hydrated. I have even been getting in some great time talking with my wife more freely, because we cannot always be so open in our conversations with our nearly teenage daughter around.

For those of you getting back out and exercising through all this social distancing I salute you, and keep up the good work!
