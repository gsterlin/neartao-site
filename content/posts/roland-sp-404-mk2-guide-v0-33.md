Hey everybody, it's been a long time coming to get the guide updated for firmware 4.04, but it is finally here! What's happened in between? Well I dropped the Quick Reference for the SP404 mk2, which was a lot of fun to make, but super time consuming. Plus within just a few days of releasing it, Roland dropped the 4.04 firmware update. I decided to invest the effort into updating the Quick Reference for 4.04 rather than the guide, and then I sunk time into getting some 4.04 videos out. It's been a crazy couple of months!

For those of you wondering what happened to 0.30, 0.31, & 0.32... well I've decided to post iterative updates to my Patreon for subscribers, but I'll continue to release the more completed output for free here on my blog. I may decide to go back and put these more minor updates up on the blog when I drop all the other content, but for now, I'm just getting v0.33 out there. For those with thoughts though, let me know.

You all have been playing with 4.04, and while the update isn't as huge in some ways as previous updates (at least to document), I do feel like there are a number of things that are more impactful for people to work in new ways. Looper is probably the standout feature in my mind from a "just get different cool stuff done", but it is kind of a bummer to lose Skipback. We cannot have everything though, and at least there's a choice to switch between the two.

I'm cool with Sound Generator. It doesn't feel quite as fully realized as I'd like it to, but for what it is, it certainly is fine. I can see a lot of people using it to generate some strange sounds by running the oscillators through different effects, all in the box. It's cool.

Beyond all that though, everybody, absolutely stay cool, keep making music, and don't forget to have fun!
