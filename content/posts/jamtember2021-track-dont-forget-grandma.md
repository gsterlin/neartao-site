So... you literally have to smile when you hear the song and see the pic together... It's like illegal or something if you don't. Now... you don't have to like either individually, but as a total package... well...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/dont-forget-grandma

The picture is of my grandmother, or as many people knew her, as the world's grandma. She was a great woman who cared for everybody. Honestly, she was amazing.

Anyways... just standard song duty for the day, kinda hit or miss again for me... probably time to push myself in another direction, but I've been trying to see what happens if I just do the same style/process for a month. What I think is happening is that I'm getting faster at the process, but also getting pickier... who'd have thought?

Well... back to it :D
