Fifteen tracks for January... woo!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/awkward-forgiveness

The picture... I believe is from Disney, from the animal park resort. I am pretty sure I mentioned how much my daughter loved that trip. We had a blast, and it was great to see all of the different animals.

This track is a mix of chops, and synths. I started by chopping up a break, and then moved on to finding some guitar sounds to fill out some of what I thought was going to be a lead and the bass... but well... the bass sound was decidedly not inspiring... and I kind of drowned up the guitar sound in a lot of this track with some of the synths (whoops). So not the end of the world, and something that could be patched up with some mixing, but my intent here was to work on keeping things in key, or as in key as I could without totally knowing what I was doing.

This resulting in a few awkward parts of the song, where some of the chords just clash a bit... and I'm confident that this is due to some of the sounds I used from samples being in one key... I pitched it appropriated to change the key, but since I wasn't considering that there were chords involved, it just kind of doesn't sit right. I suppose I could go load the content up in Melodyne and figure out what the problem is... but I was trying to do it by ear. Which worked to some varying extent... for various definitions of the word worked.

Yeah... it is definitely wrong, but it also wasn't exactly unpleasing... if you'll let me say as such. So not going to win any awards... but I was just playing around, and it definitely is continuing to push me in a way that I'm not comfortable with in this space, which is fine. I'll keep going and I suspect eventually something will click and I will have one of those "ah ha" moments, but for the time being... I'm not quite where I want to be. Gotta keep hitting the music theory books, just messing around with different scales, and really... I have been taking some notes so that I can match what I "think" is true, with what I'm seeing be the reality. For real, I think it's mostly math (for how I think about it)... so partly I just need to get the right formulas and framework situated in my head. Shouldn't be too hard, and I keep making spreadsheets to keep myself grounded, but this is not a space where I am entirely comfortable.

Why? Well in the past I'd just dial in a scale in Ableton or whatever, and have all of the keys be in tune... or I just wouldn't care. With this philosophy there comes a certain kind of ignorance is bliss feeling... where yeah... who cares if the kicks are tuned to the snares... because it's just "noise" right? Even if I'm fine with it being noise, I do feel like there is value in my pushing against this nature of mine and trying to learn more about how all of this fits together in a traditional sense. That way I can knowingly ignore rules, guidelines, or whatever... but with it does come the burden of actually taking the time to appreciate it.
