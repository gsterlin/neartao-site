For anybody looking to remix some music and/or art, I'm setting up The Uncarved Block as a forum on my Discord server. The goal is to provide a place for people to take a track or idea, and remix it into something new, and get some feedback from the community on what worked well, options for other ideas, and suggestions for what to do next. This will come together as a Soundcloud playlist to put all of the tracks together and a live stream to go over as many tracks as possible to listen to as a group and provide some constructive feedback on what to do or try next.

The YouTube announcement is here https://youtu.be/xZ3FfRZ5Bqs

The specific forum post and more details are available on my discord at https://discord.com/channels/787312035427778621/1346225665992560785 and my discord is accessible at https://discord.gg/qMuSpuxC4n

If you're interested, swing by and check it out :smiley:
