Day number four, and going strong :D

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/check-please

I did some prep last night chopping and getting some drum tracks down, but this is an entirely new track, so nothing pulled from the old archives of unfinished tracks past. I wasn't quite sure how much time I'd have today. This lead into some discovery of just loading up loops, chopping them and seeing what I could throw against the wall to stick.

Spoiler, everything stuck for this track. I used one and all tracks I put together. Some parts don't really jive well together... but I tried to make it work as best I could through conscious use of drops and bridges. Perhaps you disagree, and that's totally okay. I suspect when I eventually come back to this some parts I'll be thinking "yes that really works", and others that I think I will turn my nose at. Should I have turned my nose sooner for this track? Perhaps, but I kind of dig the wonky vibe right now.

The picture comes courtesy of my stove... and helped provide the timer, because somebody needs to check it before the food gets burnt!
