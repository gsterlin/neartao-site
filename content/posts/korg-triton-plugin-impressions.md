While I am normally a bit of a hardware snob lately... I cannot help but continue to be wow'd by just how far software has come, and where software continues to be going. For all the lack of knobs, you often get an incredible amount of features, as well as a reduced price of entry. Sure, you're ignoring the cost of the computer, but most people these days have one anyways.

Anyways... Korg just dropped something in my email that really did catch my attention, they have just released a Korg Triton plugin as part of their KORG Collection software bundle at [https://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg\_collection/](https://www.korg.com/us/products/software/korg_collection/) and I have to say, I cannot be happier.

Yesterday it was posted as on sale for the Triton plugin as $199, or the whole collection for $299. Unfortunately the Korg shop was having some internet gas or something, and was not applying the sale properly for most of the day. Last evening it must have sorted itself out though, as I was able to pick it up with the release/holiday discount. If you go all in, make sure that the discount is applied properly!

The Korg Triton Studio was \*the\* first piece of hardware I bought after I got into producing music, and being an all around music hack. I still have the Triton in the basement, and still frequently like to sample from it and chop it up. For me, it is a classic piece of gear and when it came out I just happened to be in the right place in my life to afford it, appreciate it, and really cut my teeth on it. It definitely has a special place in my life.

I have been seriously considering picking up a Korg Triton Rack, but it is pricey, you don't know what problems you are inheriting, and it most of the eBay/Reverb postings have none of the upgrades. So you're left with a perfectly fine, but stock device, and the upgrade boards are quite expensive.

I had purchased the Korg Legacy collection years ago, and was incredibly underwhelmed, the mini MS-20 hardware that came along with it was adorable, but ultimately it just didn't wow me, and I didn't bother upgrading. Perhaps something I should have considered, but it wasn't anything I was terribly interested in at the time.

Which leads me to the Korg Triton release. Uhm... I did get it... I couldn't help myself. So far, what I've played with, it is quite accurate in reproducing the Triton sounds. I've lined it up with the presets on the hardware, and it effectively sounds the same. Good job Korg engineers! I'm especially interested in the reproduction of the arpeggiator, it has some interesting features that haven't ever really been reproduced that I've seen in software, though I might not be looking hard enough.

Things that are missing...

- No MOSS board emulation... understandable to some degree, but still a bummer. You can get a lot of these sounds out of other emulators in the KORG Collection bundle, but if you just want the Triton, well, at least for the time being, I haven't found them.
- No sampling... If you were like me, and part of the Irish Acts community, digging into the Triton, replacing sample sets with other samples, and just making a lot of new sounds, it doesn't look like you'll be able to import them. All the FACTORY and EXB sample sets are there, but it doesn't look like you can import your own samples. At this time at least.
- No sequencer... you'll need to bring your own from a DAW or external hardware or something.
- No import/export... If you've got programs you've made elsewhere, there isn't an easy way to bring them back into this software.

Even with the things missing, I do have to say that I'm digging this software. I'd be interested to see if they take it anywhere else, but honestly, for what it is, it is a quite solid release in my mind so far. Yeah, yeah... I've been fanboying a bit, but it is still a solid release in my mind and immediately brought me back to the joys of playing around with my Triton Studio when I brought it home for the first time.

Here's the bog standard Triton Acoustic Piano sample:

This is the same phrase, but with one of the EXB expansions:
