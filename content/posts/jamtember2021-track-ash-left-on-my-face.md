This one was a blast to put together...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/ash-left-on-my-face

The image is a photoshop filter on a record. So nothing... exactly exciting... but well... whatever.

To put this track together was a bit of work digging for samples and finding stuff that I liked. The hardest thing was actually pulling the bass together. Originally I had a non stop sound, and was applying different gated filters, and it just felt wrong. Like it should belong to an electronic or techno sound. It was nice by itself, but just not for this track.

So... off to digging around again to find something that would sound in tune and be something I could play. I ultimately looped all the components, except the bass, and just played the bass out to how I felt through the sections of the track. Then I had to go back and fix a lot of the double hits or low velocity hits. It was a bit of work, but I do like how the movement in the track turned out.
