Alright, it's _Beatober_ and time to try and focus a bit more on beats again. Just trying to kick the tires on a stringing a single song together between the Eurorack and Akai MPC Live mk2.

The picture is just from my dog being sleepy on the chair beside me. Felt like a good chill out song and she's not chilling out much more than this.

As far as putting this all together... I've been slowly building out the rack patch, and I setup the Akai MPC outputs 3/4 as the drums going through the top of the rack, and outputs 5/6 for the piano and bass on the bottom of the rack. This is then all going into the ST Mix for mixing a somewhat clean signal together with a copied and glitched out signal. There's a lot of knobs to be trying to keep in mind while also muting and unmuting parts, so I probably just need to work out my process a bit more consciously to keep it all in my head.

For this particular track I didn't setup any gates from the MPC to time anything with the eurorack, so there's actually no clock going on. I figured it might make for some more glitches from the various modules that might be interesting on their own.

Overall, for what the track is, it's honestly made from components that I'd probably make a 45-90 second track at best, it's just a bunch of four bar loops, that by themselves aren't doing a whole lot and are only seeming to get more interesting once running them through some FX. Note to self, I'll want to consider automation for the effects to see what I want to actually record, and honestly, I probably should be thinking to record the outputs a bit better as well so that if I ever wanted to mix a track out in the DAW further I could. As it stands, I kind of get what I get for a performance, which as a charm to it, but I'm not sure there's a lot of people interested in this style either... maybe for playing something out live, but I don't know so much about for a more professional kind of recording.

Who am I kidding, nobody is listening to much of this stuff anyways!
