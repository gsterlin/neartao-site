The image comes courtesy of a business trip to Bangalore. The pool with the blue lights looked amazing so I had to take a picture. I'll have to keep an eye out for more of these eye catching images... and maybe I can do a better job getting a "live" photo on my phone... or a video... so I can work out some neat video tricks versus just having a video of me clicking on guitar pedals and such.

The friendship bracelet is courtesy of my daughter. While my wife has been away on vacation, my daughter decided to make friendship bracelets for the family. She has taken it away a few times, when I've been more parent than friend, but for the time being I have it back :D

The plucking string/harp sound really kicked off this song. I heard it, and new I had to use it in a song. For whatever reason it reminded me of the glass bells sound you used to find in a lot of older hip hop songs, which meant this had to be a hip hop track. I mean seriously... listen to that sound, in all its glory!

Today I really only constructed ten patterns. Two four bar loops, and a couple of transition/drop patterns. I liked how it came out, but it felt like it needed a bit more FX so I processed it through my mad Chase Bliss Audio science lab. Mistakes were made in the recording of this track, but an artist is supposed to take the mistakes a build on them. I've built a tower!

Listening to the track again, I think the Condor could have been used to reinforce the bass for most of the track, the bass is a bit wimpy and could use some additional oomph. The Wombtomb added some really awesome phaser effects, but you'll hear when I was turning the knob the slow sounds great, the fast sounds great, the middle part... not so much. When I practiced a little to get some good knob settings, I definitely got some great sounds out of the Generation Loss, but I wasn't as impressed in the recording... I am chocking it up to the difference between Wow and Flutter, and I picked the wrong one in the recording. Well Generation Loss wasn't bad, I just know it can do better. What else? Oh, Mood scares me in live situations... I had some really cool sounds when I was practicing, but it is totally hit or miss when you've got complex sounds going and when you engage/disengage the sample really matters. This try, Mood missed... \*sigh\*... some day I will learn to control it better.
