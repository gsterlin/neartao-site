Fifteen fifteen fifteen fifteen!

I am still having a blast making loops in Reason and exporting it out to the MPC for chopping up. This track had a lot going on with it, and I had fun making the initial four bars... but once I got started tracking it out into a song things really went sideways. The transitions just didn't work and the track started to fall apart. I think it was more a case of a few different sounds just not supporting each other very well and while I was having fun making the four bar loop it wasn't obvious, but when trying to put transitions together it became a bit jarring.

With some more time and thought I am sure that I could have worked something out in the track to pull it all back together, maybe even recording some different parts to see how I could make it work. Instead I went for something to just simplify it and take out the sequence sections I liked and let it stand as a rather more pulled back and simplified track.
