Boy, another big update. I was planning on moving to a weekly schedule for updates to be more consistent, but these bigger updates also feel more draining. I'll have to think about it.

[NearTao's SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.17](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.17-2.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.17-2.pdf)

Most of this update is just writing up the effects section, and I tried to stick to give my thoughts and advice for the effects, rather than just rehashing whatever is in the manual. As with a lot of the guide, I'll eventually come back and rewrite sections, or add some more content, but as it stands, I don't want to write any more about bread and butter effects that you can find anywhere. Although it is alphabetical, you'll certainly find where I started to loose my mind trying to write up something about some of the effects.

The bigger news is probably that I've started uploading a series of five minute videos, with the intent to try and break down discrete steps for making a song into about five minute sized chunks. Over the course of six to eight videos, you'll hopefully get a sense for different workflows to get from the start to finish (or in some cases possibly just hit the eject button on) a track. At the moment I've got an internal commitment to keep this to a video a day until I hit 100 videos, and then kind of take inventory of how it went and if it makes sense to keep doing more. I am confident I can do this for a long time, but at some point I am just concerned that I'll start retreading old material too much, and it may become less interesting. If you want to check it out, head over to YouTube.com/neartao and let me know what you think.
