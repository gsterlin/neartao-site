Well, I broke down and got a guitar pedal board today, so I could more easily work with multiple pedals. Before it was one at a time, but not any more. Now I can run them in series and mix and match for some more interesting effects. I'll have to start posting about putting the pedal board together and powering it. Oh and hacking on the plastic to get everything to fit, but I'll leave that for another day.

Today, I wanted to record some piano. Some jazzy chords, played a bit out of time, but routed through the Chase Bliss Mood with the slip filter running, which makes it pretty hard to make things sound like they are played in time. This formed the basis of why you'll see some of the chords sound like they are the tail, and other parts come in much louder. I then routed this through the Chase Bliss Generation Loss, which you'd think was drizzling the noise into this sample, but no, I can thank my USB charger for my computer for this. I figured I was going to add noise anyways, so why not leave it in. I'm not sure I have a ground loop problem or something else, but it's quite noisy, and I know it's from my external USB C graphics, because when it is running off the battery it is fine. So all of that it is run through the Generation Loss high pass and low pass filter, then dumped into the Gen to bit crush quite a bit, and with some added flutter.

Anyways, [Sloppy Piano](/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sloppy-piano.wav) is the result, if you want to take your hand at chopping it go nuts, it's got some interesting sounds here, but as I said, due to poor playing, and the Mood slip, you're not really going to get any straight chops. Given enough time you might be able to loop it and surprise me though.

From here, I just did the laziest chops you can imagine for the MPC 1k to create [Sloppy Piano Chop](/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sloppy-piano-chop.zip). This is not something I'm terribly proud of from a chopping standpoint, but I found it quite fun to play and figured it'd be worth it to share. Good luck and have fun!
