I have been getting back into using guitar pedals for external effects processing, and had some fun messing with the Chase Bliss Mood again. This started life as an Ableton Live clean Stratocaster patch that I put together, and played through the Mood. What I played initially sounded like an unaffected guitar, but with the Mood always listening, and using the old blood side's always listening micro granular in tape mode, I came up with this bass sounding loop [Moody Bass 01](/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/moody-01.wav). This was recorded into my MPC 1000, and I sliced it into a drum kit [Moody Bass](/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/moody-bass-mpc-1k.zip) for the MPC 1000 on JJOS. You can certainly take the initial loop and chop it in a different way, but I decided to just do a relatively clean chop and tightened up the start and end points in the drum kit.

If you've got the inclination, you don't have an MPC 1000 with JJOS, you can certainly still use the .wav file chops... they are 44.1khz and 16-bit, so just about anything will load them these days. If you end up using anything from these sounds please link it, I'd be interested to hear what might be done with these samples!
