Just kind of done for the day... not thrilled with the track, I just know it could've come out better. Spent too much time trying to make it work, and also kind of feel like I should have just ditched it and moved on.

The picture is some really amazing graffiti from Hawaii. some really talented artists out there! Wish I had time to see more of what was going on out there, but what I saw was definitely solid.

To make the track, I tried to go for another vaporwave sound, which is probably what bit me the most. I sent the layered 4 bar loop over to the SP 202 for pitch processing (down 4 semitones)... and then brought it back to the MPC. Where I think things went wrong was probably just in the sound selection, and stacking it all together. I also tried playing some tube synth along for a bit of an FX/ambient sound, and I had to do a ton of processing to try and get it to fit with the original track.

Worse, I super overdrove the drums, and while they sounded cool this morning, as it has gotten later in the day I just didn't really care for the sound any more. Just tired though, long long weekend, and I probably just did too much and feeling picky now.
