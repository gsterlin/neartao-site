Well my first statement here is, if it says Non-Functioning... be prepared for the device to not function :D. I was interested in getting a repair project underway, and see if I could breath some new life into a busted device, and while I thought this was going to be a case of soldering work... well check this out... while I am pretty sure it is worth what I paid for it in parts, well I'm just saddened to see how beat up this really is.

{{< figure src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/99d1f477-1d68-410d-afad-a60e004da54c%5F1%5F105%5Fc.jpeg?w=768" alt="" caption="" >}}

The metal frame is bent, and the PC board is all broken to hell. While the device does power on, it is completely unusable in this current state. No problem I thought, I could go off to MPC Stuff and pick up a new board, and I ordered one yesterday. Unfortunately they wrote back that this is not the case, while the system let me order the Q-Link and volume/record knob board, they just wrote to inform me that they are all out of stock. Bummer.

So no board, and I'm not really interested in buying \*another\* MPC 500, as I'm not too interested in scrounging for parts. This leaves me with the decision, do I try and repair this, or do I just sell it for parts and move on? Not one to back down this early from a challenge, I think I'm going to take a stab at repairing it. I'll post a "hey anybody have a spare board" on MPC Forums, and I'm also going to look into seeing if I can super glue the board together. This will likely require some soldering work to repair the traces or bypass the traces... but it is all for the sake of learning something new right?

Anyway, if somebody out there sees this and has some thoughts, feel free to reach out. I'd appreciate any advice I can get, thanks!
