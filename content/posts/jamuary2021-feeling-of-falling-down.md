Day 20 and I just went for more ambient... so veg out a bit and see where it takes you

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/feeling-of-falling-down

The picture comes courtesy of my back yard. Well I sold my house, so technically now it is the new owner's back yard, but I am currently still living here. Setup a lease back arrangement while I am waiting on the new place. About a month to a month and a half to go... and believe me, I am ready... it's about time to get my damn music studio back together so I can get access to sounds that I want when I want them. That said, it's been quite nice to be working with a greatly reduced set of sound sources... so it hasn't been an issue by any stretch of the imagination.

Today's track was a little bit of everything thrown in... the hardest part was just slowing myself down. I'd get a line, and then start dropping all kinds of crazy stuff. To take my mind off of some of the normal ways I've been working the last nearly two months, I drizzled effects all over the track liberally... this helped take my mind off of the drum sounds especially... so I could kind of noodle out a rhythm without weighing myself down with trying to make a rhythm, if that makes any sense.

The biggest part of the day was just searching and manipulating sounds to get to where I wanted to go. Once you kind of set into a direction, sometimes the things that sound cool in the moment just are not so great... gotta use your ear :D
