Not sure how many people are NI fans... I used to be deep into the ecosystem years ago... but this is pretty big news!

[Native Instruments selling to Francisco Partners](https://tinyurl.com/yy7uznun)

Given the release of Machine+, and the sheer number of instruments, effects, and downloadable content for expansions, there will clearly be a lot happening at Native Instruments over the next few years. I'll be interested to see where they continue to go with the stand alone boxes. The technology continues to deliver on more and more portable power, and there's certainly a market for NI to capitalize on.

Now I guess it is back to sipping tea, and wondering what In Music is going to do with Akai as a response. My guess is probably nothing, but I'm willing to be surprised :D
