This Sample Pack was first published to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/neartao). Head over there if you'd like to learn about getting early access to the Sample Packs I am putting together.

I put this Drum Kit together with the intent of making it quite noisy in mind.  It's a bit more of a harsh industrial kind of sound, so you're likely going to want to apply effects to tame these sounds a bit.  A lot of what makes it rough was running the sounds through sample frequency reduction and a pretty heavy level of compression.  This gives the tails of the sounds an especially unnatural nature.
