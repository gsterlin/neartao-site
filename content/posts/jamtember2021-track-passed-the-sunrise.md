Just a straight up Eurorack event today... nothing else...

https://youtu.be/Ip\_SaybZesY

Above is the recording that I did on the eurorack, from just a couple of samples in both the Morphagenes and stretched to their limits. There is some digital artifacting or clipping sounds, and I'll be honest, it is hard to tell if it is coming from something in the chain specifically I am doing wrong, or just a side effect of the Data Bender doing it's thing and I wasn't paying attention to what I had it doing.

A minute or so in I decided to hit the 4ms WAV Recorder to make sure I had a higher quality recording as well... and maybe it was clipping? I'm going to have to go back later today and see what might be giving me the hard time because some of the glitchiness and clipping sounded good to me, and some of it was definitely not intended. Ah well... here is the track on soundcloud as well.

Comparing the audio levels on the YouTube recording through the Zoom H6 (which was definitely not clipping) and the 4MS WAV Recorder definitely leads me to thinking that I need to experiment around that space.
