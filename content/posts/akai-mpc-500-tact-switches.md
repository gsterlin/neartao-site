title: Akai MPC 500 Tact Switches

The initial repair has shown that the previously busted up Akai MPC 500 has in fact been noisy mostly from the obliterated Volume and Q-Link board. So I've been able to use it for a few days, but the next problem that has surfaced has been that some of the tact switches have been a bit finicky, and require multiple presses to get them to register a press on occasion. This is super annoying, and definitely slows down your workflow.

As a result, some of the tact switches on my MPC 500 haven't all been working incredibly well. At some point they probably will need to be replaced, but for the time being I figured I'd try some Deoxit sprayed into the top of the switches to see if it might help.

Above you can see I popped the top of the case off, and boy is everything kind of dirty, the pads in particular stand out, but there is a lot of grunge around all of the buttons too. So here you can see I took off a fair number of the button caps, and let me tell you... I took them all off and rinsed everything under water and wiped them down with a dry paper towel. There were a few strange colors that came off of some of the button caps, and I will try not to imagine what that was about.

In the above image it is kind of hard to see, but I basically got a drop of dioxin on every switch, and then I pushed each button for about 10-15 seconds to help work the Deoxit into the switch. After that I spent five minutes or so wiping the PCB board to make sure that there wasn't any left over Deoxit remaining on the PCB. While it may be fine, this poor MPC 500 has been through enough, and doesn't need extra debris and liquids floating around.

In this picture, I have begun to put it back together. You can also see that I had my Swiss Army knife out. I was using the bottle opener as a way to help push the clips in on the button caps to help release them from the PCB, since some of the spaces were a bit tight for my fingers.

All in all, this was a pretty quick job, and I'll keep you posted on the results. While I was in here, I did spray some Deoxit into the Master and Record knobs, as well as the Q-link slider, and the data wheel. The Master and Record knobs seem to work a bit nicer, but the data wheel seems a bit tighter now. I may have to work the data wheel a bit more to break it in, or perhaps I've munged it up and now it will need to be replaced. I hope not, but stay tuned. I'll also mention that the Play Start/Play/Record/Overdub/Stop buttons seem more responsive, but also perhaps a bit mushy. I'm not sure if the Deoxit helped here or not... time will tell.

I'm not really excited about how the foamish material around the display is disintegrating either. It's basically shedding, so instead of keeping dust off the display, it is making a mess on the display. I suspect I can come up with an easy hack to fix this, but it also goes to show how some of these components just don't age well over time.

If I was to do this again, I think I'd consider skipping the tact switches that are working fine... because getting the top off and removing the button caps really isn't that hard. I just had it in mind that I would save some time and do everything in one shot, but I may have ended up causing myself more work in the future. We shall see.

I still haven't gotten ready to do the audio line cap replacements just yet. I have most, if not all of the caps I need to do this job, but so far it still sounds pretty good from an input and output standpoint. I suspect most of the noise will go away if I get a power adapter, the batteries on the MPC 500 always seemed to generate a little noise for whatever reason... so I'm not too worried about it so far.

One other note... as I have been slowly cleaning the MPC 500 off, it still hasn't lost the curry smell. it isn't killing me or anything... but it is absolutely noticeable. I'm going to have to invest some time in figuring out how to get rid of the odor at some point.
