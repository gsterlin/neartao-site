title: Electro Funk Challenge Key Groups
url: /2020/08/13/electro-funk-challenge-key-groups/

As part of the Electric Funk Challenge over on the MPC Forums I ended up with a bunch of extra key groups and a drum kit that I didn't end up using. Well I used it for the original track that I put together, but nothing made it onto the finished track.

Here's the in progress track, that just got too muddy, and I lost the project files and haven't felt like recreating this thing...

First up... here's a bass sound I recorded off of my Moog Voyager. My initial thought was to create something that was not an 808, but could bounce through the track. While I like this Bass sound, it also isn't the 808 that I think you need on an Electro Funk track.

Next up... this is a pretty straight up Sawtooth synth patch on the Moog Voyager, it does pretty well cutting through the track.

I mean... this is pretty smooth. I dig this sound and hopefully you will too.

The Blazed sound is probably my least favorite out of the box, and it probably needs a bit more filtering to be tamed. I wanted to do something with the high end... and if you listen to my track you'll probably hear where it wasn't working so great.

These drums come courtesy of the PO-32 Tonic. I was trying to recreate some of those harsh drum machine sounds, and I do like the drums here, unfortunately in the track that I posted above you cannot really hear the drums because the track got too muddied.

Anyway, good luck and have some fun with these sounds!
