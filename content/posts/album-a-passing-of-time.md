This was the third album I put together and was still heavily influenced by Acid Pro, I think I was using Acid Pro 4.0. I was getting far more comfortable using loops, the interface, and was starting to incorporate the Triton Studio into my productions too. Sometimes I would play a lot by hand, other times I was just playing chords and letting the arpeggiator do a lot of the work for me.

Listening back to this music is just reminding me of times sitting in the book store with my laptop with headphones on, and just noodling out songs and trying out new ideas. I was probably seen a lot with a copy of Computer Music or Future Music by my side as I flipped through articles and just listened. This was definitely a fun time for me because I had learned enough to be "dangerous" but was still really unsure what worked and didn't. I'd have to say I'm still satisfied with where this work lands, and it was a lot of fun to put together.

Besides, I've never been into music creation for the money, it's been about having fun, learning, and being able to meet new people.
