I'm not going to link off to anything I am selling, as I am not looking to drive attention to it or try and raise awareness. Instead I figured I'd write up why I am going about selling gear off.

Over the last year I have really been looking to tighten up my process for making music. I also have spent about twenty years collecting gear, and some of that gear has had a habit of collecting dust. It is no particular fault of the gear, but when we work on music we're constantly making choices, and a lot of my choices are of the type "this versus that" and "I know how to use this really well and that other device not so much".

This has led me to having some level of nostalgia for some of these gear, as I got it at a certain time in my life, or for a specific project, or I just really like it for some reason. However nostalgia alone doesn't really help me make music. While it might inform my tastes of what gear to use, it isn't really helpful as a way for what makes for a more effective process.

Case in point... when I was goofing around in #Jamuary... I mostly used the Pocket Operator KO-33, and while it is definitely not the best sampler... as something you can have in your pocket for when inspiration strikes. I made more tracks just goofing around with the Knock Out than I had for quite some time before that. Are they finished? Nope, but it really helped get the creative juices flowing.

Back to the old gear, I've had a lot of Korg gear, Akai gear, Moog gear, etc... all just sitting in the closet. Once I got passed the emotional level "need" to keep it, I've been having a great time moving the hardware on for a new generation to play with, and it's been helping me fund my next gear I do want to get to. It has really helped me understand the value I have on my gear, and what I can actually get out of it. Sure, some of these boutique pieces of gear would be hard to replace if I wanted it again, but on the other hand they had their day with me.

Anybody who's out there... I would really suggest thinking about your gear and how much of it you really need instead of just holding on to "just because". For me it has been a great exercise that I will continue. This isn't Pokemon, and there's no reason to "catch 'em all".

For me, my new rule is to only keep what I have the time to take care of and maintain. Now to see how well that keeps working out for me :D
