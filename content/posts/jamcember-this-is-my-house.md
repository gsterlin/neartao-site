Seventh day, strong day!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/this-is-my-house

This is a picture of my house when I first bought it. My daughter used to call it potato brown. My wife and I have done so much work on this place over the years, and are in the process of moving into another house. I'll miss this house, but it was my first house, and it'll hold a special place for me and my family!

Anyways, this track was something that I started a week ago using one of the MPC kits, I think it was Deephouse. I was going to work on some change ups, get some additional sound sampled in there, all that good stuff... but then I figured I'd see what I could do with the sounds in there. A few things got chopped, trimmed, and some FX, but I don't know... I wanted to see what I could do by adding in more sounds, and doubling up some things. If this was going to be a real finished track I'd add some automation and sweeps... but this month... this is how I'm rolling. Fast and furious my friends, fast and furious.

I did hit an annoying thing I don't like. It's almost definitely a bug, but I'm just calling it something I don't like for now. When I went to track -> explode, there were a few bumps, so I used "undo"... made a few tweaks... and then did track -> explode again. Dang thing left me with empty exploded tracks from the undo, and then created a whole slew of additional tracks after the break of blank tracks. Clearly the undo should create clear tracks, not just empty tracks... but there's something weird here. I am quite certain I've hit this issue before, and just didn't pay it any mind. Honestly, it wasn't so bad Track -> clear about 24 or so times... but it was also unnecessary. I'll just have to take note and try and remember for next time. Or stop being so lazy creating a track with all the notes on it and going to explode. I suppose I could just record each note on it's own track like I tend to prefer... but where is the fun in the moment for that.

Akai... fix your stuff! :D
