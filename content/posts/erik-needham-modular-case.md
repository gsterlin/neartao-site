I ordered a case from Erik Needham back in January. I've been waiting patiently for six months or so now I think. It's been a balance of waiting to get the modules together I wanted, and trying to get more room by selling off gear I don't want to use any more. If you want to check him out go to his Instagram [Needham Woodworks](https://www.instagram.com/needhamwoodworks/) or look him up on [Reverb](https://reverb.com/marketplace?query=Needham%20woodworks). Definitely some great stuff.

Check out what I got to see today!

It's looking great so far, and nearly ready to ship!

Just a view that the power is coming on. Cannot wait to get this into my hands and install everything!
