This picture comes courtesy of Photoshop Camera on the iPhone with one of the goofy filters. I was out RV'ing with my family and my parents for a couple of days over the weekend... which held me up from having time to pull together more of a track. I was split on the track this week, and was messing around on Sunday afternoon on the MPC, and the yesterday I flipped to try to put a track together on the PO-33.

I actually had some really good stuff happening on the PO-33, but it is very easy to accidentally change, delete, or otherwise mess up your sounds on the PO-33. There is not really any easy way to backup the device, without dumping the entire memory rather frequently. You can probably imagine where this is going... but I accidentally deleted several of the sequences on the PO-33, and ended up just throwing my hands up last night. Today I figured I would just go back to what I had on the MPC and go from there.

Frequently for the Beat Battles I have been skipping the mixing and mastering steps, and this time I decided I would spend my free time on leveraging the [YA Mastering](https://www.yorgosarabatzis.space/store) on the Akai MPC that I picked up a while back. This took me some time to wrap my head around, but honestly the instructions are pretty well explained, I think they could just be broken down a bit better without so much "refer back to section <x>". The sound was definitely punchier... more so than I have gotten from most of the tracks I have tried to complete on the MPC only. I'll definitely at least give the template a few more shots, and see if I can drop some A/B comparisons on what was put together.

Overall to put this track together, I didn't really do too much work sampling, I cut out what I thought sounded useful, did some EQ'ing, and really just focussed on one shots on the MPC. I had a few cool loops on the PO-33, but... well that ship sank. For the drums, I just grabbed sounds out of some expansion content that I had sitting around, so it wasn't anything terribly fancy here either.

As per usual, I split the tracks out, and then made multiple sequences for sections of the song and used track mutes to build up the song. Something I haven't done often, was convert the song back to a sequence, and then add some additional flourishes and sounds into the track to help add some more interest.

All in, I cannot recall how much time I put into this track, especially considering the PO-33 problems... maybe I got a four hours into it, 2-3 on the MPC and maybe an hour on the PO-33. I am pretty happy with how the track came out, but I still think it could have used a bit more time spent on the mixing elements to get it to pop a bit better. Better luck next time?
