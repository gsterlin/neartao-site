I hit twenty four days of closing the workout rings on my Apple Watch in a row yesterday. The rings are Move - 740 calories, Exercise - 30 minutes, and Stand - 12 hours. I've found a roughly two to three mile walk will get me there for the day, and takes me about 30-40 minutes to complete. I can also hit the Calories goal with about twenty minutes of running, but that has been a bit rougher for me. My allergies kick in, and I have work induced asthma. I'll work through it better in the future, but as it has warmed up and gotten more humid outside, I haven't really wanted to run.

I am still really just focussed on creating good habits for myself, and not trying to challenge my younger self. I have especially found that where I used to be for running is long gone. I realize that I am not in my twenties anymore, but my goodness was it a shock going up a relatively reasonable uphill slope. It was much harder than I remember and really took my breath away quickly.

For now I am happy to keep going out for walks, and otherwise using the rowing machine as a backup for when it is not great weather outside. It is unlikely that the walking is helping me too much with stamina, but I figure it will help me build up a bit of a base and get my body used to raising my heart rate through a fast paced walk before I try to get back to jogging and running. Besides, from all this walking I am embarrassingly sore through a lot of my body, but in particular my legs are feeling the burn. I just keep reminding myself two things, this won't last forever and it is part of the process to get my body into a respectable shape. I have absolutely gone from no exercise to heavy exercise in the past, and just given up. My goal is to not give up so I have to accept this slower pace and commitment to making the time. Plus, when my wife has been available it has been a great opportunity to spend some time together that we may not otherwise have.

If anybody else out there is considering getting back into any kind of physical activity routine, my advice is to just do it. The hardest start was actually breaking my behaviors that created feedback behaviors with my family. As I mentioned a few weeks ago I would ask if anybody wanted to walk with me, and then would get a lot of "I will be ready in five minutes" or similar, which reduced my time to walk, or put an easy wall to stop because by the time the family member was ready to go, I was out of time.

Instead, I am now announcing "I am going for a walk in thirty minutes", or letting my family know "I am going for a walk now", and if they are able to join me or can make it happen it is great, but otherwise they have now learned when I am ready to go, I am going. I am not giving myself the choice to hold back for much more than thirty seconds, and it has really helped me get out the door.

Good luck, and get yourself out there!
