title: Older Firmware OP-1 Patches

I was looking around for something completely different, and happened to stumble upon this Reddit thread [\[DOWNLOAD\] OP-1 Patches (op1\_14203)](https://www.reddit.com/r/OP1users/comments/5gkx43/download_op1_patches_op1_14203/) which was posted to the OP-1 sub forum for users that wanted access to the older patches provided by the older OP-1 firmware. The direct link is currently still available to a google drive folder that somebody was nice enough too put together [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6r0Q-Lf6Fe5QVoxV3RBYm5DaFU).

For me, this is an interesting find, because it isn't always easy to find the older firmware for devices, and often when you do find the older firmware it is missing a lot of features and functionality to the point of not wanting to downgrade. What is great about these patches is that they are drop in replacements for the OP-1 and gives you some view into what the older firmware was able to do with sampling and the sound engines, without the need to downgrade your device.

My assumption why these older patches were removed is mostly to save space for the newer added sound engines, as well as to help make room for newer content that could be interesting for new and existing users. The OP-1 definitely has a limited amount of space, and storage usage is a premium due to the older technology it is built upon.

Even though these patches are older, many of them are worth taking a look at, especially if you're a newer OP-1 user and were never exposed to them. Enjoy and have fun!
