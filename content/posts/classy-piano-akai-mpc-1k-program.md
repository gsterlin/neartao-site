Well now, this has been sitting in my drafts for way to long.

Where did this even come from? Oh yeah, I made the loop in Reason, using a piano patch... which one \*shrug\*, I forget. But I definitely used the Scream FX to add some wow/flutter, how much? I don't know... take a listen?

So apparently the danger I have is not writing enough notes down when I prepare these posts, and I also need to get myself better into the habit of just writing the content of these posts... below, the next two lines are what I wrote.

[Classy Piano MPC 1k Program](/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/classy-piano-mpc-1k-program.zip) ???

Super helpful right?! Going forward in the future I'll do better.

I know I played some "jazzy" chords, but for the life of me I cannot remember the progression, scale or anything else. Could I use Melodyne and maybe figure it out? Maybe... but I'm not going to bother. This is a life lesson for me, and either I will get better, or I'll keep having not terribly helpful posts.

I am also continuing to wonder if I'm just not better served with a proper vlog setup, so I can take videos, and then have it all recorded there, in wonderful HD to go back and see what I did. Not yet though, I need to get some more posts under my belt and make a better habit of the whole thing.
