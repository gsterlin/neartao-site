Day 24... down to the home stretch!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/heading-out-west

The picture is from... oh my... two summers ago now, took a road trip out to Montana with my parents, wife, daughter, and dogs. That's my dad's Jeep, hooked up to the back of the RV and ready to go. That trip was an experience, but I would absolutely do it again given the chance. Was a great opportunity to spend time with the family, just veg out on the road, and see a lot of things I just wouldn't normally get a chance to see. Sometime I should go through the pictures and see if there is anything neat to write about.

As for the track, I struggled throughout the day to get anything down. It didn't help that I have packed up more gear, so I think I'm almost down to the Eurorack setup and my Akai Live as the only instruments I have kicking around. I tried doing some fun/wacky stuff with the Eurorack to get some neat granular sounds going, but nothing really came together in a way that I was happy with. Maybe if I was in mind for just making something experimental or ambient, but I guess that hasn't been much of what the last two months have been about for me. Maybe they could have been, but I feel like I've developed some muscle memory for getting around in some specific ways, and well... it wasn't jiving with where my head was going.

This ended up coming together as I just got super old school with how I've put stuff together in the past, and just loading up some sounds... laying down a beat and such... and then finding new sounds that I liked to layer in and messing with 16 levels to get as much out of each sound as I thought I could squeeze out of it. I basically didn't give a damn about keeping everything in key, so some parts are a bit wonky and off... but whatever... I'm chill today and just happy I got something down.

To put it all together, I did go back to exploding the track(s), and then doing the sequence/copy sequence/mute tracks song and dance to get a lot of content that I then strung together into a Song. This leaves the over all song not feeling quite as dynamic as it could have... but I'll manage to live with it as it is. Whatever the means, I do feel like I accomplished something way more than I was bound to do from how things were rolling this morning. I'll take it as a win :D
