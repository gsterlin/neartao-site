Well... I hit 100 subscribers, which feels like an accomplishment... hah.

Yep, that's it, instead of the long string of random numbers and letters that once defined me, I now have a vanity URL. So... special.

The funny thing is that I can see in the analytics it's not any of the music videos I am doing that are drawing people, it's all the tutorials, of which I don't think I have done any since June or July. Should I do more? I'll have to think about it I suppose.
