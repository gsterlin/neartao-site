This weeks [MPC Forums BB 282](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=198794) is a go! This week's challenge is to use an instrumental style track, and to make a trap beat, with a boom bap build up. I'm not terribly familiar with making trap beats, but I know the genre well enough to give it a go. Besides, trap is what dark vibes, ratchets, whoa/yeah/what shoutouts, and is pretty diverse BPM wise. I guess I forgot the shoutouts on my track though, so at least one mistake. Or was it? No, I forgot to put in some murmurs, shout outs, etc... but I don't think I'm going back to update the track.

Instead of trying to cap myself off at the 60-90 minute mark, I figured with it being a nice Father's Day weekend I'd go for closer to three or four hours. I'm not sure exactly where I landed in there... but I did spend more time on this track than a lot of previous beat battles.

I got most of the initial chopping done on Saturday, and then spent some time playing around with getting a kit together for the trap sounds. From there I really just messed around with trap sounding patterns until I had something that I felt was livable... and could then bounce off of and layer the chops off of.

Once I got that settled... I programmed in what I figured would make a good boom bap drum track using the same kit... and oops... I forgot that I had my trap BPM at 160, not 80... so the boom bap drums played double time. Not a sucker to waste anything though, I decided to make a copy and then use the track function to cut the track speed in half. A curious note when doing this... the MPC Live does not appear to move any automation... because that seems to have stuck around. Weird that the notes move, but that the automation track stays at the same speed. Is this a feature or a bug? Definitely a bug, but something I suppose could be abused by those who take note and work it out.

Getting through the boom bap drums, I then went back and made some more variations using the chops. This worked well and good, getting me some fun sounds, but definitely not dark enough. I ended up fiddling with a few other attempts, and think I got a few tracks darker, but it didn't really feel trap dark to me. Whatever that might mean.... \*shrug\*.

So the biggest problem I landed on with this track, was that I really lost patience trying to put this together on the MPC. It just did not want to play nicely at a certain point because I had too many programs, automation tracks and other things going on, that I could not nicely explode the pad hits into unique tracks that I could then mute and unmute like I normally would.

This drove me into loading up Ableton Live, and hooking the MPC up in controller mode to be able to record off the loops. It worked okay, but it was a fair bit of time spent monkeying with recording content that could have been better served mastering the track. However, a nice side effect of dropping this off into Ableton was that I could use the visual spectrum and eight eq mixing to get a better sense for what was going on in the audio field in a way you just cannot do with the MPC in standalone (at least right now).

If you look at the waveform data you'll definitely see that it is rather "quiet"... whether you like this or not... well it tends to mean that there is more dynamic range, but that it also doesn't compete with similar tracks that will have a better mix and mastering. My expectation is that folks who take the next steps will blow the doors off of this track!
