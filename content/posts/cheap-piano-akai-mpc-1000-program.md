I'm pulling together on a track on my MPC 1k, and have been playing around with a few piano sounds. The initial sound comes from the OP-1, from the Fake Piano patch under the DR Wave engine. I liked this sound as a starting point, and it reminds me a bit of the old Casio keyboards from the 80's. I changed the presets a bit, and in particular turned off the Spring reverb as this was giving it a bit too much presence.

Post OP-1 tweaking, I routed the sound through the Chase Bliss Generation Loss to really abuse the sound. In particular I added some Wow to give the sound a bit of somewhat repetitive but also unstable character, and added some mild noise in order to dirty up the noise a bit while also running it through the low pass just to clean it up a hair.

Once I was happy enough with the sound, I setup a basic eight note pattern on the OP-1 with Endless, matched the BPM to the MPC 1k, and recorded off the passage. The outcome was [Cheap Piano Recording](/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cheap-piano.wav) which I'm pretty happy with as a source to chop from. The trimmed and chopped MPC 1k program is the [Cheap Piano Drum Program](/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cheap-piano.zip), and reading this is making me think I need to worry about my naming conventions or I'll make myself crazy in the future.

While I am not totally sold on recording this level of unstable audio through the Generation Loss for chopping purposes, the duplicated notes in the phrase do show themselves to be unstable in varied and unique ways. I suppose if you're constrained for memory, this is not a reasonable technique because you would want to leverage the effects post sampling not pre sampling. On the other hand, the MPC 1k does have 22+ minutes of mono sampling time, and for my new track so far I have used maybe 30 seconds max.
