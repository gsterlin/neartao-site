Yesterday I got myself some credits on NeuralBlender... and actually started buying some art... whaaaaat.

Decided to spend some time today trying to think about a way to use the Morphagene as a sample player of some sort... and got a couple samples going... didn't go for anything crazy or off the rails... but they both got some more action today than usual... so instead of just using them as a passthrough for the MPC outputs, they got some real sounds going... haha.
