[session-54.5-by-sa-samplepack](/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/session-54.5-by-sa-samplepack.zip) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/session-54.5-by-sa-samplepack.zip)

These samples were recorded as part of my In Five series for the SP404 mk2 Session 54.  I used a Teenage Engineering OP-1 and a Chase Bliss Audio Mood to do a bit of sound design/exploration and to have some fun.  Nothing fancy here, but since Spicy Boi asked over in the YouTube comments for the samples, I'm providing them for anybody to grab.
