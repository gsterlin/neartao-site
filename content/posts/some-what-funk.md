The picture is of a 3 string cigar box guitar my dad made for me. Something I've been trying to get to work better for some time. I'll get into it in a blog post somewhere, but my dad didn't align a few parts correctly, so it needs some love!

As for the song, I was really just trying to go for a straight up hip hop/break beat kind of sound, and keep it moving. I like the track overall, but think it could use some stripping back of a few elements, and maybe add something a little different? I don't know, seems like something I am poking on a bit for what I've been putting together lately. Time for some self reflection?

Hopefully that guitar will get some love though, gotta see where things land time wise once I get through this month of tracks a day.
