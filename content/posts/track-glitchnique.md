If you can believe it... this came as a result of two different tracks built pretty much at the same time on the PO-33. This one was made up of 12 patterns, the other one used the other 4 to mess around (I'll post the other track below). The same samples led to completely different inspirations.

I'm not entirely sure that I'll keep doing these kinds of visual videos or not... it added a bit more production time to something I just wanted to goof around with. Plus, since it was posted (a month ago) it's only gotten one view... so yeah... not terribly popular. It was fun to play around with the software on my iPad though, so I suppose it isn't a complete loss. I'll just need to keep my mind open and learn.

The problem as I keep reminding myself of taking a month to write these posts is that I forget pretty much everything that went into the production of the track. I really need to form some better habits here.

I'm probably not going to bother posting anything about Getch Ya Hype other than this... first because I erased all the content for the track, and second it was really just to prove a point on the MPC Forums. Folks be whack sometimes.
