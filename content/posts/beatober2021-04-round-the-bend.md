Yeah... not really sure what to make of this... other than way too many patch cables... it's a serious mess. I don't really know what I have done any more.

The image is just my work pc... with a mysterious rocket flying into it? I don't know... I hardly could muster the energy to pull this together. Guess it's just one of those brained out lame tracks... that I couldn't really figure out what to do with it... and everything I did made it worse. Good thing it was maybe 20 minutes of time invested, instead of a lot of work that would make me sad.

Still... here's the strange patching mess. I don't even know how to describe it other than I just patched a ton of stuff into other stuff... and the process was fun... but it's just weird and scary now. Maybe tomorrow I'll do a beat while deconstructing the patch? It could be one last hurrah for this patching upon patching upon patching mess before I move it to greener pastures :D. Below is what this hot mess looks like if you don't watch the YouTube video.

so... yeah... I cannot control this beast anymore, and definitely need to start fresh!
