My track for Christmas... woo!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/saturday-night-jive

This is another track that I tried to go for a more minimal sound, and it was made up of only three loops. I know the track itself is not very complex or technical, but I worked on making up for it by making a few variations of each loop to get some variety in the flips. Given that I am still doing a new track a day, and time has been at a premium, this gave me a bit more time to be picky on the loops that I chose to work with in order to put the track together.

I'm interested to go back to the start of this month long project and see what I have for some thoughts on the progression of how I have been putting tracks together in such a short time, and what I might carry over to my regular production techniques.
