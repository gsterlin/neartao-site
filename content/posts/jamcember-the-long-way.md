Eighteen days, it's been eighteen days, dropping a beat every day, so many ways...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/the-long-way

This track... I am still making loops in Reason Studio and looping them... this might be the last one for the month... not because I don't like the results, but just so I can experiment with some other track making techniques... or who knows... go back to finishing off some older tracks. The next few days we shall see.

For this track, I did about the super laziest chops, and just chopped up on regions... nothing fancy, and it made it much harder to control where I wanted things to land, because... hahaha... I forced myself not to chop on the transient. Some transients were landing on triplets, or off beat, not at the start... whatever it was. Made for some surprising tracks, and made it a bit more difficult (or impossible) to line things up the way I wanted... but I figured it was time to change how I was approaching the tracks.

I suppose on the plus side, putting this track together was quite fast, because in many ways I just could not, would not, or just wasn't interested in puzzling my way through some problems based on how I approached the track. Oh yeah, all the programs were mono so I could flip out on the pads a bit more... but this also meant that I couldn't play two drums at the same time from the same sample. Reflecting back on it, it was a rather silly and arbitrary thing to push myself on... but I did get the track done faster. Will I do it again in the future? Maybe... but it isn't something I am going to have in my back pocket bag of tricks to go to all the time either. I just found the process a bit more boring, even if the constriction helped me push faster.

I did try and make variations on a few parts as a result, and this was a "good idea" in practice, but I suspect what I really should have done if I was going to commit to these two silly constraints entirely was to just play out 32 bars of content and just work with the feel instead of also constraining myself to a 4 to 8 bar section, and then muting content in and out.

So... maybe I should reconsider... I do think I should make a full track start to end with 32 bars, and just play it all out as I feel it. but I am not sure if chopping the way I did is a good solution or not. Guess it'll be another thing to push for this month and just try.
