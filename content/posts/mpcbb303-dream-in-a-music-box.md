Submission for [MPC Beat Battle 303](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=210474&p=1825311#p1825311) over at MPC Forums. You still have time to submit a track :D

The picture comes courtesy of a trip I took with my family and in-laws to a butterfly garden when the kids were just two or three. The girls really loved seeing all the insects in their natural habitat. Especially since it was winter outside, and in some sections nearly tropical from the level of humidity. It's amazing to see the life cycle of these sometimes so foreign creatures.

To put the track together, I just sampled the intro, and went from there. I felt like it had enough harmonic content to work with, and while my initial instinct was to dirty it up a lot, I actually didn't get too crazy here. I had been thinking a dirty track would be fun, but about the dirtiest this gets is just from the tape delay. I have to say though, the track has plenty of amazing content to work with and I'm definitely excited to see what the other submissions sound like.

Once I had the intro chopped up to my liking, I did have to tweak some of the notes. One of the notes in particular was very short, and I really liked the tone of it, but it just wasn't fitting. I ended up opening my utility belt of tricks, and just put the note into a forward/backward loop so that it would keep the same tone, and not create too many clicks/pops or sound too awkward when doing it. Of course to do this I had to change the note from One Shot to Note On, and then there came a lot of messing around with ADSR to try and get the volume of the note to be somewhat similar to the other notes playing. I would give myself a "B" for how it sounds by itself, but in the mix I don't even think you'd notice it unless you knew it was there and tried to look for it.

I ended up recording a few variations of playing the notes out, straight, staggered, and kind of grooved out. From there I realized that I wanted these to make a bit more of a tapestry of sound, so duplicated my program to make a -12 semitone, as is, and +12 semitone version of the program, and then duped this for the playing style variations and program semi tone variations to build up a matrix.

At this point, I decided it was time to start laying out the sounds through track mutes, and keeping mind to make sure that each of the program versions was only playing one melody, and it worked well, but it did lead to a bit of a complicated mess of track mutes to work through the way I did it by recording track mutes in live. I did have to go to the list editor a few times to tweak the notes... and holding shift saved my dang life to note have to adjust 960 values... wooo.

With all of this settled... although there was a bit of a bass sound, I decided to look for another section of the song to drop -24 semitones. What I came up with I liked, but it sorted of dropped in a bit jarringly at first. I ended up working out some automation to sweep the sound in... which is a bit janky to some extent, but it worked much more effectively than what I had before that.

This lead to me taking the time to break the drum tracks into somewhat discrete parts so I could overdub in some track mutes for the drums.

Overall I'm pretty happy with how this all came out, but of course, there is always more room for improvement :D
