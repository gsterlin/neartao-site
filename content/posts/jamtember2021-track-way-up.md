Expecting today to be a bit crazy, and I woke up early. So got the dogs out, and decided to get to business. Dogs out at 6:00am, fed, and in front of the MPC by 6:10am. Looking at the clock now and it is 6:52am. So factoring for upload time and stuff... I guess a 35 minute track from start to finish?

The picture comes from my trip with my family to Hawaii. Was taking an early morning walk with my wife and saw the bird up in the tree. Not sure what kind of bird it is, but it was definitely striking!

For the track, I wanted to lean more into a lighter sound, though the limiter at the end of the chain changed that up a bit, I still think I captured most of the dynamics I was going for. This turned out to only be three loops used this time around, and I spent more time digging through the MPC Synth sounds to grab the Mellotron for the choir, Hype for the strings, and Odyssey for the pad. I didn't want to spend a ton of time on sound design here, and really just did some subtle insert effects by and large.

What definitely makes this track different is that I put a Talkbox insert effect on the entire track, which is why I ended up needing the limiter on the end to help get some of the automated dynamic changes under control.
