This track is better than yesterday... though still needs some tweaking.

The picture is just some flowers that my wife bought... Calla Lilies if you're interested. We're trying to get more flowers in the house and make it feel more like home.

As for the track, this is straight up another MPC Live track. I grabbed a handful of samples and just got to chopping. I know I could have done a better job getting some of the slices together, but I tried to do it by ear as much as possible, and hey, I continue to approve of the slightly wonky and janky sound. So it was a lot of using the threshold chop mode to get the party started, and then adjusting the start/end points a bit by ear. I know for sure that a few of the mistakes in the chops came from forgetting to turn off the linked slices afterwards, but I haven't really been doing much for tracks over the last TWO months, which has gotten me quite a bit out of practice. Only done a few hit or miss beat battles in between, and I hadn't even bothered to write up a post about them. Well, I do need to get myself more focussed again

Honestly, to kick off making the tracks, I started with mostly putting together a handful of two bar patterns, the kick and snare, with a bit of high hit thrown in for good measure. I didn't even go back to make any changes to it... \*sigh\*. Maybe next time. From there I quickly realized that I'd want to go for four bar measures for a few of the sections, notably the flute and string sounds, because what I was tapping out needed a bit more space to come together and resolve.

This lead me to a bit of mixing, because I was getting a lot of digital clipping and I basically dropped all the tracks down roughly -9db to give myself more headroom, which I promptly kept eating into by adding the harp like sound and some more percussion. Plus at this point the sounds were starting to interfere with each other making it a bit harder to pick them out, so I put a generous amount of filtering on most of the tracks just to take out some of the harsher sounds and help them all sit in their own frequency ranges a bit more nicely.

At this point, I had doubled the sequence again to eight measures, and just popped it out to sixty four measures by doubling it three more times. This left me with a track that I just hammered through the track mutes by hand... which mostly worked fine, but you can definitely hear some of the poor timing I did leaving a few of the transitions feeling a bit off. I absolutely need to practice this some more, as I clearly have gotten out of practice some doing this a few months ago.
