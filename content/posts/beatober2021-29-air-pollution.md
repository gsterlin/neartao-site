A day track this time...

https://youtu.be/HbXDBwXj53k

Recorded off some samples onto the SP-202, slowed them down, and tried to get a bit of the LoFi 1 crunch to get a bit into the Vaporwave space, but this is definitely not 80's inspired or reminiscent… so I guess it is something else.

Resampled the loops back into the MPC so I could line them up better and get everything into sync, then added drums. There's a touch of Mimeophon on the instruments, and the Instruments/Bass/Drums are getting some Data Bender treatment. I suspect the Bass being so dang low is a mixing problem… especially since I didn't take the time to mix the track. Oops… will save it off and see if it is a track to come back to in the future to refine.
