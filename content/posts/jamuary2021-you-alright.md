Day 21 was not going to be a happy house track... but yet... bring on the bright and happy vibes... I guess I could use it...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/you-alright

The painting is from when I used to record art lessons and post them online... I think I did about 100 episodes, under the title "Painting in Five". This particular one was showing how to paint out a rough sketch, and I'm quite certain it was based off of the lion from the MCM Grand. At any rate, the idea was to just show people how to quickly get some things down without thinking too much about whether it was good or bad. And now... about twenty years later, I am doing a track a day just to get myself to put something down. Maybe I should bring back the "In Five" concept in the blog? I've been thinking about it, but haven't committed to anything yet.

As for the track, it is almost entirely Akai MPC Live... and just a bloody expansion kit at that... so nothing terribly fancy... except that I did grab my PO-33 Knockout and say "yeah" into it, and then recorded the clip pitched around a bit. So... "yeah"... it wasn't terribly complicated. I'm still trying to practice track mutes a bit better, so who knows, maybe I'll end up making some longer tracks as I get more comfortable muting live... I used to be pretty good at it, but it seems to be a skill I either lost, or am struggling to get back into for some reason. It's likely lack of practice and over thinking it... that's my excuse... and hey, at least I am trying!

So all I really did here was create a 4 bar track, explode it, sequence duplicated to a 32 bar sequence... and then record track mutes. Easy?
