So uhm... apparently I forgot how to operate my gear... clearly what happens when I take a break for a single day and use the pocket operators

For this track I disconnected the entire hot mess from a couple days ago... and just really went to focus on basics. I decided I wanted to try recording in a few chords into the Morphagene and then using Pam's New Workout on a random LFO to send a change to which splice was selected... and it works pretty nicely except for one problem. The Morphagene doesn't switch to the next sound until partway through playing... so either I need to work out clocking issues, or change config.txt settings or... something. It works fine for this track more or less, but required some playing around and bumbling around to get some rhythm that sounded like it could work with it.
