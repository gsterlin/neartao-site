It is Monday the 21st, and that means it is time for the 21st track!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/new-found-glory

The picture is from my trip to Athens Greece with some filters on it. Nothing fancy, but the statue was incredible to see in person. It's made out of plexiglass or glass and stacked up to look like a person. We walked by the statue quite a bit for our family trip, and would definitely go there again!

As for the track, I was shooting for something a bit more instrumental, and maybe a bit dusty for the piano sounds. I kind of feel like the vibe is there, although maybe the crunched up drums and harder synth bass are a bit much. All the sounds kind of fell together and worked in a way that I liked.

All of that is to say that I had intended to do some other work in sound design outside of Reason, but I was fighting with my Akai S950 to get it to output audio. I suspect it was my fault... and I have it working well enough now, so probably time for some sound design outside of Reason for a bit moving forward.
