Taking some time to experiment with the 1.14 firmware release that just dropped. Going to take a bit to roll some of that information up into the Guide.

[neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.9](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.9.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.9.pdf)

The big update for today was finally running the experiment to determine polyphony once and for all for the mk2.

Spoiler: it's 32 note mono sample polyphony. If you're using stereo samples then you've only got 16 notes of polyphony.
