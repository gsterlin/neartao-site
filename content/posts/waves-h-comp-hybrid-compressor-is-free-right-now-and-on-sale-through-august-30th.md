I know I haven't usually posted plugins or anything... and maybe I should... but sometimes a deal is a deal. Just happened to see this when logging into the Propellerheads site and stumbled upon the shop to see that the Waves H-Comp plugin is currently free at  [https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/](https://www.reasonstudios.com/shop/) on sale for $49 through August 30th... and with promo code FREECOMP it is free. Just grabbed it yesterday. I still need to install it and check it out, but hard to pass up a free plugin, especially when it is usually going for $200.

A few thoughts... I initially thought that this was a reason rack plugin, and it appears that it is not. It is a VST (and maybe audio units?) plugin. So you can still use it within Reason Studio, but you'll need to run it as an external effect. This is obviously fine, but you won't be able to use it as a standard rack plugin if that is your jam.

Haven't checked it out myself yet, but did pick it up and got a license without paying a dime.
