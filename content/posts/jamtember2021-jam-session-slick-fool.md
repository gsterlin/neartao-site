Last track/jam for the month... going to see what I can put together for beatober next :D

https://youtu.be/in3OUNSvj6U

Last time messing around for the month, and wanted to fix up a few things on my patching. For this, I ended up just doing two different track ideas and routing one track through 3/4 of the MPC, and the second track through 5/6 of the MPC. This then went into both the Morphagenes, mostly because it was already hooked up this way. In fact, I tried to mostly use what I've been building up for a patch over the last two days, but I did straighten out my mixer to have the ST Mix have 1) Track 1 FX chain A 2) Track 1 FX chain B 3) Track 2 FX chain A 4) Track 2 FX chain B. This helped me keep some sanity for which ST Mix knobs were controlling which parts of the sound.

I also did add to the signal chain for track 1 the Sqwk Dirty so I could do some HP/LP filtering of the track, and I had intended to do this for track 2 as well, but honestly, I forgot, and then got into messing with the track and wasn't able to do it. Bummer, but, I figured I'd make do and see what I could come up with.

Also... hit over 300 tracks on soundcloud... holy smokes!
