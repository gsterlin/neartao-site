A few hours of work here today, wanted to get more done, but needed to do some family stuff like cook dinner (tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches), wash the dogs... and whatever else took up the day.

[NearTao's SP-404 mk2 Guide 0.8](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.8.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.8.pdf)

This latest update is quite a bit more than I've done over the last few days, a lot of links added to the reference section... some day I'll get ahold of a service manual link to add in, or figure some things out and add some of that documentation, but for now just a lot of links mostly for videos people posted about the mk2, technical information, various forums. I'll probably end up pruning it down a bit, but figured I'd see what it started to take shape as.

I also took some time to check if the microphone or guitar input had any interesting overdrive or distortion characteristics. They don't, same old digital clipping as the line level inputs. I'll see what I might be able to do on the USB-C inputs, but I suspect that is likely to be just more digital clipping. So.... I continue to say that unless you want digital clipping, don't let your EXT SOURCE go red... you're much better off using a compressor if you want to increase the overall loudness of a sample.

There's a few other things, but it's been another day of bouncing around a lot as I tie of on another experiment, and a handful of things I wanted to research.
