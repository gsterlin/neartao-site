I've still been taking the dogs out on walks with me, and trying to get both of them at least a mile a day. The oldest pooch Amy continues to be super stubborn. The first eighth of a mile she just stops. Today I took a picture.

No more walks dad!

I have tried a couple of tactics to change this behavior, and so far have not had any success.

**Treats**

Amy absolutely loves snacks, to the point that we've had to keep an eye on her diet enough to ensure she doesn't turn into a foot rest. We've kept her around twenty pounds for several years now, but she was about twenty five pounds a while bag. She just loves food, and knows how to beg for it.

However, food has not been a great motivator to teach her new skills or motivate her to take specific actions. She is getting older, and it is easy to think she is just getting stubborn in her ways. That said, the biggest problem with bringing treats on a walk is that it becomes a giant distraction for her, with her trying to jump up to my hand or paw at the pocket that has the food she wants so badly.

I've been concerned that with the treats, she is so focussed on the food that she really isn't paying attention to where we are going, which would be okay, but she also doesn't pay attention to where she is going. This has been to the point of me worrying about her getting caught up in her leash and her sister's leash, tripping over things, and possibly leading to a serious injury.

**Waiting**

Another tactic I have tried is when I feel the leash go taught to just wait for her to come to me. She never does this, and if I give her some slack she will immediately turn herself around and start pulling to go back home. I do not have all day to wait for her on the end of a taught leash to move forward, and Amy is super patient.

So yeah, I don't have time to wait, and as a side effect to waiting, or other dog Zoe gets super agitated waiting as she wants to continue the walk, leading to her running around and nipping her older sister. While this might not be an immediate problem, I also haven't wanted this to cause problems between the two dogs.

**Plow Ahead**

I have tried the tactic of walking fast enough that Amy doesn't really get the chance to dig in her heals to stop, and it does cause her to become a bit of a drag, which I suppose could be good from an exercise standpoint for me, I have been concerned about stretching or pulling her neck when using a leash attached to her collar.

Certainly I do not want to cause any long term damage to her, and while this has caused her to keep up better, it also makes it harder for me to keep tabs on her when she has to stop to go to the bathroom. Overall I'd say it's not a great strategy, and I would not suggest it, at least while leased to the collar. We do have body harnesses, and as I type this up I am reminding myself to give this a bit more of a try while she is leashed with the body harness.

**Alternate Route**

By far this has been the best strategy, just to take her on walks that take her through areas that she is unfamiliar with. Amy is a very stubborn dog, and she does not like things to change too much. The good news is that once I get her onto a new path, she is happy to just follow along and really only stops to go to the bathroom. The bad news is that she knows the area around our neighborhood pretty well, and we have to keep doing wider and wider circuits so that she does not know exactly where she is until we are ready to get her on her way back.

Since I have been working to spend more time exercising and getting outdoors though, this has lined up pretty well with my own personal goals. I can tell you, I am definitely getting to know my neighborhood more intimately by walking side streets and areas I hadn't bothered to explore before.

**Summary**

For me, taking alternate routes to walk around the neighborhood has been the best for myself and for my dogs. You might wonder why I am going through all this trouble, and the answer is to get us all healthier. My goal has been to get both of the dogs at least a mile of walking in a day, and it has really helped them a lot by giving them more energy and raising their attentiveness levels. They both do love being outside, it is just getting Amy moving in the right direction that has been a little challenging.
