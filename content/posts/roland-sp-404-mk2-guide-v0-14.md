Spent some time on the Sample Edit section, and tried to think about how to discuss some workflows without getting into it too deeply.

[neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.14](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.14.pdf) [Download](/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/neartaos-sp-404-mk2-guide-0.14.pdf)

I'm trying to strike the right balance between opinions, thoughts on how to do things, and just stuff that feels like issues with Sample Edit. Maybe I am being too picky, or maybe these things could just work better.

Still happy with the mk2 though, and will continue writing things up. I've just started a new job, so trying to balance transitioning my old work, picking up new work, family, and working on music, has caused me to slow down a bit on the guide for a little bit. I promise I am still keeping at it though!

Thanks!
