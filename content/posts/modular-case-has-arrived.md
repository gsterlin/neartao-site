Well I got the notice from UPS that the case was on it's way, and it will be here today! Super excited to get my hands on it.

Here's a few pictures of the package and opening up the packaging.

The UPS delivery person said this was one of the best packaged shipments he has ever seen, and I have to agree. We flipped it (shhhh... don't tell Erik Needham). This is a beefy case, and I have to say, it looks like some pretty good quality wood for the case.

Above, I had unscrewed the front, but it wouldn't come loose (lots of staples, but I thought maybe some glue). I got the back off a bit easier, a few staples were looser and I was able to get a crowbar in there to loosen this beast up.

Took a bit of work to get the case loose from the coffin, and it's looking good! This is much bigger than I had expected, woo boy. My wife is going to kill me :D

Let's see how the weekend goes (if my wife kills me) and if I can get some time to start mounting modules.
