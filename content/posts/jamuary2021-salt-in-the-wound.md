Day twelve...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/salt-in-the-wound

I tried to slow the track down here... and... well... I kind of like the sound of it, but you can tell just listening to it I drifted off into some mental space that wasn't so focussed on the track... I suspect this is what happens for creating a new track a day for a month and a half. I wanted to like it, and I wanted to feel like I was being productive, but instead I felt like I was just slamming content together. Worse, this was me just chopping loops up... which normally I dig, but I think being the first day back to work, I just kind of got 'meh' about it. Oh well... there's another three weeks to go of this?

I suppose I wanted to feel inspired, but just missed the mark. This is coming off of yesterday where I literally threw in the towel too, so it kind of hurts. Need to dig deep to keep this up!
