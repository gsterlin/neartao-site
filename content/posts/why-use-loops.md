New MPC-Forums poster DCS created the post [WHY LOOPINGS](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=210413&p=1824936#p1824936) ~ "As an absolute beginner i would like to understand why loopings are used instead of tracks for beats. What are the advantages and do you use loopings for any music genre?"

While I somewhat wonder if this is some form of spam, it is a good question (as I interpret it), and I figured I'd respond and it felt like a good topic for my blog to dig into a bit further.

What is a Loop

For people just starting out in music, a loop is generally a piece of audio that can be played and will repeat (usually seamlessly) over and over again. You will frequently find things like drum loops, piano chords, bass lines, etc... all recorded as different and unique sounds, and sometimes you'll find loops that combine all of these sounds together.

{{< audio src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/triton-1-polyphet.wav" >}}

However, there are a few important factors to consider about a loop. A loop will have a tempo/bpm, or in other words how fast or slow the content in the loop plays. This used to be very important to know because you often want to match the speed of two different loops so that they sound like they are playing together. With modern technology though it is much less of an issue, especially in software due to advances in time stretching algorithms which allow you to change the speed of a sound without affecting pitch.

Another important aspect of a loop, especially melodic content, is what is the scale or key of the loop, so that you can pick other sounds played in the same scale/key. If you do not do this, you can find yourself having inharmonic content playing that can sound off. I'm not going to say what is the right/wrong way to put sounds together, especially in this kind of a blog post, but it is something to either be aware of, or understand that you may want to learn more in this space at some point.

Why Use Loops

There are plenty of reasons to use loops in your music, and I would generally extend this to include drum kits, key groups, or other sample based content that you didn't make yourself.

A loop can help provide you with a rhythm or groove that you want to have in your song structure while you are just getting started. Plenty of people will take a drum loop for example, and just start jamming to it and recording their instrument. Later you can come back and remove the drum loop in favor of playing drums against your other recording to get a unique sounds, but that has been influenced by the tempo, swing, and overall feeling of the loop. Anybody who has been making music for any length of time has used this as a technique to help get the creative juices flowing.

Related to this idea, a loop can help get you some structure to your song so that you can focus on what you want to play yourself. In this case you may decide to keep the loop in your song, and then focus on playing the instrument that you are most comfortable with playing or want to practice. Loops will give you a consistent tempo to play against and can make for a diligent way to practice and be able to hear if you are playing on time or off time to the loop.

Sometimes you just want a certain feel or vibe, and you might not know how to make certain sounds yourself. A loop can be of any audio content, tone, texture, or type, and a loop pack that you like might have something extra special that adds character to your song. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using the loops that grab you and hold your attention.

Why Avoid Loops

On the other hand, there are also plenty of reasons to avoid loops, because there can be a lot of awful, poorly produced, or not clearly marked and identified content out there. This can lead to content that is not usable, useful, or otherwise is hard for people to leverage.

The biggest problem with using loops in your song is that it can lead to incredibly repetitive song structure. It makes it very easy to turn the music production process from thinking about what the producer wants and what the listener hears, into a process of just making a song that is loop on and loop off. This is absolutely a great way for new producers to start learning the ropes, but if you find yourself just building up song structures and sections by having a loop play and then not play, you will likely end up boring your audience.

When using loops it is also difficult to change much of the audio content. Yes you can add filters and effects to change the sound, but once a loop is created you cannot often to back to the loop and add in a new piano note or drum hit. For a new producer, this can be frustrating because until you've developed the skills to know how to get around, you may find loops are more restrictive than you had initially thought.

Depending on where you are in your journey of music product, one other thought I have is that the use of loops can impact your ability to publish content. If you intend to sell your songs on a music service, expect to be asked to provide licensing information, and this can be a real hassle, especially when you start to find out some licenses allow you to use samples in your songs, and others allow you to use the loops for personal use but require a separate agreement to publish your music.

Going Beyond Loops

If you're looking to work with loops, but want to start getting into the next level, then I have a few suggestions.

Learn multiple ways to chop up loops. This will allow you to change how the content is played, and depending on how you chop, can impart a more unique sound. One thing to note is that with all the graphical editors these days, it is still worth learning how to listen to a sound and chopping with your ears from time to time. I am always saying "if it sounds good, it is good", and I mean it. Just because something is chopped to look visually pleasing doesn't mean you've got your best chop. Being sloppy with your chops can add some unique and special character. Especially if you're using all the sounds that others are using.

Chopping up audio also can give it a bit of a cut short sound, and this is a core characteristic of some sample based music genres. Bits of silence, a little mistake hear and there, use your artistic license to know when it is good and when it might be taking something away from your music. There's interesting things to experiment with, and having reverb tails cut short, or bleeding into the next chopped sample can give some very interesting atmosphere to your track.

Learn to use effects, this can cover a lot of gaps and mistakes. For example, adding a little reverb to a sound can help flesh out a chopped up loop, and gives the new chops some room to breath. Reverb won't cover every blemish, but it can be something to experiment with. Similarly, use a low pass filter on a drum loop to help isolate some of the bass drum sounds, you might like how it comes out.

Look into software like Melodyne to determine notes/chords/scale of loops if you cannot do this by ear. Melodyne can take a loop and break it into parts so that you can see the notes that are being played, adjust them individually, as well as telling you what chords and scale are in. This can all be useful information to help you match loops with other loops or adjust a loop to fit with the track you are producing by keeping the tonality of the loop, but allowing it to fit within the broader context of the song.
