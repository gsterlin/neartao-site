Day 6, and put this together.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/lets-grab-lunch

This is another Boss SP 303 sampled song, I spent a \*lot\* of time sampling into the SP 303, and then resampled back into the MPC. There are some things that I like here, but boy was it a lot of work, and honestly, I'm not sure the result was entirely worth it.

I like some of the sounds and how they came out, but I feel like this is not really that great. The Vox probably could use more work to make it different or change over time, and this is where I feel like I'm hitting a bit of a wall with producing exclusively on the MPC right now. Just a bit too much work to pull the audio apart and do something different with it.

I am going to have to think about what I want to do for next steps soon, and which direction to move to for music production.
