Has it already been fourteen tracks?

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/welcome-tangerine

This track needed some mixing love, I tried to nail it, but I still think the saw synth is a bit intense. Perhaps this is what the track needed? I'm not sure. After this many tracks can I really be sure of anything?

Well, I am sure that all of the content was yet again produced in Reason Studio, and I ran it through the Yorgos Arabatzsis Mastering. I'm getting a bit more of a handle with both making loops in Reason Studio 11, and working with YAM to get the sounds I am looking for, and pushing the sounds I don't like back.

Or you know... just cut them out and don't use them. One of the loop bounces had this decent sound that I like at the start, but it clashed with everything else because it had a fade in compared to the rest of the loop... which made it sound incredibly out of place. I also got some dueling drum loops to chop and play with, but the synth drums... oof... they had this pulsing sound in the background that I wasn't quite sure what to do about. I ended up leaving it in for a few sections of the track, but it was a little much.
