This week's challenge on [STBB Forever is #697 - Claude Debussy](https://stbbforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=711). Rules were pretty open, go find your own Claude sounds. I ended up listening to a \*lot\* of this Youtube track

{{< youtube qRZmdzCGLYw >}}

I didn't listen to the whole thing, but I did consume a lot of it. There is a lot of great music in here.

I grabbed a few different elements until I ran out of memory on my PO-33 (yeah, hitting that again lol). The only addition that is not from Claude is the drums, which come courtesy of a Guns N' Roses break. I then ran the PO-33 patterns through a armada of Chase Bliss Audio guitar pedals, to in particular really wear the sound out furtherâ€¦ compliments definitely go to Condor for doing some EQ duties, Warped Vinyl for wearing done and warbling some of the hits, and Generation Loss for really cutting into some of the tape noise/wow/flutter. Mood provided some great inspirations that I was really hoping to add to the track, but it was just too much, and the track was becoming too complicated in spite of the cool and fun sounds.

There wasn't anything too exciting, but I did make a lot of different sounds with this that I recorded into my Zoom H6, and then loaded it up into Ableton Live to just chop and process a tiny bit. Live mostly just did tracking here more than anything other heavy lifting. I had a lot of interesting ideas, but unfortunately they just didn't work out well in the track, so I just nixed that junk off. I've still got the stuff in case I wanted to do something wacky later, but I wanted to take this track a bit more seriously this week and not get too wacky.

Of course, if you've listened to any of my tracks, you know that I do get wacky from time to time.
