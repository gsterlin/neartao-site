I hit a 53 day move/stand/exercise streak, and I am not going to lie to you, mentally it has not gotten too much easier than it has been. Meaning, I am still doing my best to get up and move around, but there continue to be days where I do question how important this is to me. I guess it is more philosophical in some ways, because yeah, I know this is important for my health, but a big question that keeps coming up for me is why. Why do I want or need to be healthier? Do I need to loose weight? How much better shape do I need to be in? These questions are certainly all normal, and I do have the answers to them for myself, but I'm finding it important to remind myself more often.

One thing I think that has been important for my sanity has been to keep most of these goals and motivations to myself. I know some people look to their support system around them, but for me, other than blogging about this, I haven't had anybody I have talked to about exercising beyond "want to go out for a walk" for the most part. I don't have a desire to change anybody around me, and I don't feel like I need that external affirmation of how or why this is good for me. I do feel like I am sleeping better, and while it is slow, I am seeing the pounds fall of here and there. Maybe that shouldn't be plural though, it is more like... a pound every week or two, because honestly, I am not trying that hard to make big changes. Instead I am working on how I typically run my life, lots of little changes. It's probably more boring to watch and observe, and can seem like not much has happened, but I guess it is also who I am.

I am also finding that Amy is a lot more in general happy to go for a mile walk, which is also good. I always had dogs growing up that loved walking, and Amy is just so interested to go out, but not interested in it enough to not want to turn around right away. I've been working on breaking both Amy and my wife's habit of deciding to turn around, and sometimes this is working.
