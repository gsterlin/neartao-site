Still in a kind of meh... for making music day... but hey... still having fun and got a chance to mess with Neural Blender some more. So that's nice :D

As for the track... well I tried to use some automation on Morphagene... to limited success... and just ended up dumping the drums and Vox from the MPC out to Sqwak Dirty and Data Bender... so uhm... I dunno... just a simple thing... but I kind of feel like I need to start from a bit more of a square one and figure out what I'm actually interested in doing again.

Just been a weird week... been in that "kinda down" place... found out my role is getting moved from one department to another... and then mixed up into something else... so gonna have to decide what I want to make of that or do with that... Nothing I'm long term worried about, but just the kinds of stuff that can make you think differently about things and force you to take a step back and reassess what your values are. And as for that, I guess I'm kind of in the "I'm not sure space"... definitely need to sleep on it and see where I wake up tomorrow.
