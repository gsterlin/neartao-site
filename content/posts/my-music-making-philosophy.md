I've had quite a few people tell me that what I do is recognizable… and I'll be honest, I don't think I _do_ anything specific process wise, but it's likely more to do with a few factors.

As to how long… I've been making music off and on for about twenty years. I was super prolific around 2000-2009, but that's about the time I ended a few collaborations. I was "this close" to breaking into the video game music industry through connections, but it didn't happen in any grand way due to circumstance beyond my control. I did some indie game music, but you'd never be able to find it… heck I don't even know if I could find it :D. Anyway… a bunch of life stuff happened… I carried a torch for making music, but had to put it down almost completely due to insane pressure at work, family, and I decided to get my MBA. Once I graduated I decided to throw myself all into making music as a hobby instead of a lot of the other dumb stuff I was doing… so that's probably helped a lot.

Overall though… I guess I can summarize my philosophy a bit…

First, I absolutely make music for myself. So for better or worse I know what kinds of sounds I like, and I am sure my particular taste is what you're hearing.

Second, I do take feedback, but just what resonates with me. Folks telling me my mix or mastering is whack… it's like okay… that's great… I'll mix it and master how I want… but if some suggestions come in that are a straight up improvement then yeah I'll spend some more time on.

Third, over the years I haven't done anywhere near as many collaborations or work with others as I used to. No particular reason really, and some day I'll probably try and get something together, but the licensing and contracts got to be a hassle when I was hardly making any money and just gigging for fun… I didn't really want to learn about what that would look like at scale.

Fourth, I tend to be pretty chop heavy, it's just that 80's/90's sound, so those hard chops and big reverbs are always an easy thing for me to reach for. I wouldn't say that I do anything special here per se, but I'm less interested in perfection, and do lean into the "if it sounds good it is good". So some days I will get super surgical on a loop or whatever, but I'm not afraid to let it just be super sloppy and play it to make it work.

Fifth, I totally dig the old school 8-bit and 16-bit era… so that sonic crunch from 8-bit, and those awkwardly looped sounds from the 16-bit era… I mean I'm in. I've got probably too many samplers… but I just kind of grab whichever mood I am in and shoot for it.

Sixth, I'd say I'm pretty neutral on the hardware vs software camp. I 100% started in software living and breathing loops, but also dug into hardware and have built up a pretty decent collection of gear over the years. Now I'd say I'm pretty focussed on what I have and what I'm planning on keeping vs. what software I'm not going to go back to and which hardware I'm going to sell. Still… I think if I was told I could only have one instrument hardware or software I'm pretty sure I'd just say give me a modern MPC.

If you want some advice… I'd say be realistic with yourself about what your goals and outcomes are. Don't talk about them to others, nobody is going to be your crutch to accomplish them… you just need to suck it up and do it.

Plus, I absolutely subscribe to the belief that if you want to get good at anything you need to put in your 10k hours to master something. I've got several 10k hours under my belt for things, but music is not one of them. If I had to guess, I'm probably in my 3-5k hour mark… so be realistic with yourself with how much time you've put in and how much time you want to put in… I know you're beyond your first hour and tenth hour… do you think you've hit 100 hours? Personally I just find this is a great gauge to be able to ask yourself how do I compare to other people and how much time they have put in? What can I see and give advice for the people with less experience and what can I look to advice to those with more experience?

I'd also say just post stuff… I know folks like CharlesRandolph are all up in the "don't post whack music"… and I can see that for somebody who is making bank off their beats… but if it is just a hobby there is no harm in posting stuff and getting feedback.

Get into beat battles… it'll get you to appreciate how other people approach tearing a beat down and you also will get feedback on what other people think. There's nothing right or wrong for you to do really… heck I post trash quite often… I just know how much time I am willing to put into it… and I also know that I am going to do something that other people aren't thinking to do so I can learn something for myself.

My only other thought is, if you're looking to mess around and collab on a song or something… I'd be more than happy to bounce some ideas back and forth. Depending on which MPC you have will depend on how easy or hard it would be… but there are definitely ways to work around that stuff…

Later man!
