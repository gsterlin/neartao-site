Now I'm behind on getting updates to 3.0. This still covers firmware 2.01, but I'll be pivoting to 3.0 soon, I promise.

I'm just excited to see 3.0 drop, and this update was really just to get me back in the habit of writing updates, in prep for whenever something big happened. Last week I tried doing some live streams to chat with folks while also working on the guide, some of them worked, and some of them didn't. If you catch a stream, feel free to drop in and say hi, ask questions, give suggestions, or anything else.
