As some of you may know, I lost my job back in April as part of a 700-800 person layoff. I've had some interviews, but nothing has landed still, and I'm getting kind of restless to get back to doing \*something\* beyond just reading job postings, keeping my daughter entertained for the summer, and being stressed out about what's next for me.

I'm definitely going to start making dedicated time to do specific tasks, because I kind of feel like although I would like to land another cool job, I've also kicked off a few things with the YouTube channel that is opening up some potential different opportunities and would let me get back into being more technical.

So big picture, I'm considering getting more consistent and dedicated for a few things:

- There's still things I should wrap up on the SP404 mk2 Guide.
- I've started to stub out a PO-33 Guide. It's early, but I think it'll be shorter and help the community
- The processes I've been using to upload videos, make sample packs and all that is ripe for automation, so I should really get serious about that
