Been trying to work out some issues, and make tracks louder.

https://youtu.be/vDzTg5h65RI

This track I tried to push into using the morphagene for a bit of ambient noise to bring in and out to an okay effect. Probably something that is better to automate with an envelope so have it swell in over time, but that'll mean considering a rewatching of how everything is setup, which I suppose I am due for anyways, since over the last month I have had some grumbles about how some of the gates, attenuators, and other things have been configured. I can effectively get 4 discrete signal paths out to the Befaco STMix, and so far I've tried applying a path like MPC Live -> Morphagene -> Sqwak Dirty -> Mimeophon -> Data Bender -> STMix, and while this works, it has left Beads out, which I've then added in by peeling off the signal from Sqwak Dirty -> Beads -> STMix. There is some value in having two discrete paths for the same voice, but I think I need to consider what I'm trying to get, and which types of sounds or effects make the most sense.
