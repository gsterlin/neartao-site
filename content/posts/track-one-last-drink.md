Alright... warming back up to trying a track a day again...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/one-last-drink

The picture comes courtesy of my 6 mile walk the other day... just took a ton of pictures that I figured might come in handy for interesting song images. The empty discarded bottle on the side of the street just seemed interesting enough to me that I walked by it, turned around, and came back to take a picture.

Biggest problem with the walk is that I've done a few long walks this week, and my Achille's tendon on my left foot feels like I have two ropes rubbing together when I walk. Been keeping on it though as I don't want to favor it too much. Heck today I just aerated my lawn, which was probably the equivalent of walking for walking about 90 minutes, which might make it around four miles for me.

Gotta say, that dang aerator is heavy as heck, and my wife and I didn't really have the strength to get it into and out of the vehicle four times today, yet we did it. So aeration is done, over seeding is done, and we're ready for some rain to start trying to get the lawn back together.

As for the track, well I sampled and effected a bunch of content into the Boss SP 303, and then abused a lot of the content further with a lot of distortion on the MPC. On the 303 I was using isolator, vinyl, and other things to try and adjust the tone of the sounds, and then on the MPC I really hammered on it with Air Filter Overdrive/Resampling, Vocal Doubling, and gating to get the sound. It's a bit harsh overall, but I dunno... it moved me today and I just wanted to get started in trying to catch something even if it isn't really digestible for most people.

Planning on doing another track tomorrow, I'll try and mellow it out a bit more next time :D
