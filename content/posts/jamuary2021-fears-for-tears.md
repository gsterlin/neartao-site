Day 17...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/fears-for-tears

The picture is from a painting I did years ago... I think I gave it to my mom? \*shrug\*... somebody probably still has it.

This track came together pretty fast. I started with a pretty basic drum beat and bass line, and tweaked the FX, pitch, etc... a bit to get a bit more of an interesting sound. It wasn't long before I added in the piano. This is just a chopped up loop, and I decided to do something different, and work on make a 32 bar playing of the chops, instead of doing my usual 4 or 8 bar play through and then working with the loops. I'm going to have to consider this in the future, as it was both fun to see different ways I could utilize the sample, but I also got a few interesting places I normally wouldn't get to.

Since there wasn't so many programs to work with, and I wasn't using any external synths, it actually gave me more time to think about using what little I had for sounds in this program. I think all told, it is around 30-60 seconds of samples, and I probably only used about half of that really. This is where it is in the space that, if it were setup, I'd probably have considered loading the samples into the S950 and then flipping it from there. I might consider doing that later just to see if it has any interesting effects on the track.

Stay cool folks!
