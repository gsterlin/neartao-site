Well it looks like I am back for another month of jamming out!

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/requiem-for-a-soul

First off, the picture is of my oldest dog, Amy (pronounced Emmy). I was trying to find a picture that might feel a little dreamy, where you might not quite know what was going on, was maybe a little shocking, but not really in the terrifying space. This was a picture from taking Amy home from being spayed, and we had to put the cone on her head to keep her from licking the wound. She is by no means intimidating, and is actually one of the sweetest dogs you could find, but this picture does make her look a little haunted.

For putting this track together I stuck with the old faithful Akai MPC Live mk2, but really started by recording off some midi tracks using both the Access Virus TI2 Darkstar and Waldorf Iridium to create some ambient sounds. The Virus took the mid range and high parts of the ambient pads, and I put the Iridium on duties for the low end rumbling sounds. I had to tighten up the Iridium with some filtering and give the Virus' high end pads some more space. The MPC Live took drum and sequencer duties to help coordinate everything, and I just put the song together entirely in Song mode. It's not an exactly ideal workflow, but I figured it would be faster to put it all together this way than to make it work without writing out stems.

One thing of note... I did have to make an audio track on the MPC Live to capture all of the Virus and Iridium output. I tried to do an export on the MPC, and it didn't track out anything other than the drums... \*doh\*... Akai... get standalone to be able to export content in realtime from external gear ya bozos!

For fun, I think I am going to be also trying to put together videos for the tracks, and for a first pass I did try doing this again. Not sure if there is interest in doing streaming or videos of putting a track together, but figured I'd start here and see what comes of it.
