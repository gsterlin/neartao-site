The picture is from my daughter playing piano for a recital. It was... three years ago now? She's been learning to play piano for five or six years now, and knows far more about playing music than I do. She can sight read, has very good finger posture, and knows her way around the keys. On the other hand, I try and talk to her about sampling, beat making, song structure, and these are things she doesn't know how to do. Occasionally we will talk and bounce ideas off of each other, but she's not into creating songs, just more interested in reproducing them right now.

To put the track together... I just kind of felt like doing an orchestral hip hop track... so it's some timpani, cello, viola, and other orchestral sounds... and just some rather basic hip hop drums and a few other sounds to try and round out the track a bit. I took another pass at making the track 64 bars, and then messing around with track mutes to put the track together. This is both a bit faster, and a bit slower than making sequences, and stringing them together in a song. It's faster because if you can get it right or sounding decent out of the gate you don't have to fiddle with it too much... but it is also slower because if you mess up you then have to decide if you're going to go into list edit to fix your timing up or if you're going to undo but then have to redo everything... you can somewhat get around this by turning overdub on and off between track mute change ups... but that's one more thing to remember to do...
