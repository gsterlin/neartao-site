Below is what I had for my “every day carry” back in 2019.  This is the last iteration where I have dropped a thicker wallet and gone from 8-12 cards and cash, down to 4 cards.  The notebook and pen are new, but being about the same size as my phone I hardly notice it day to day.

While I am thinking about what I keep in my pockets or otherwise on my person I like to ask myself a few questions... “Why do I carry this”, “how often do I use this”, and “what utility does this provide” are all pretty good, and help me make sure I keep focus on what I am lugging around.

For me, it’s about keeping it minimal so I can fit it in my front pockets, and maximizing utility.  I don’t count clothing... I might consider a belt though since I do carry it every day.  I might consider it more if I found one that had a bit more function than just holding my pants up. A few fun ways to break this down are utility (how many different ways can you use something), go to (how many times do you reach for it), usage (how much time do you use it).
