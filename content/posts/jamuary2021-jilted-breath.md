A quick one for track 25...

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/jilted-breath

The picture is of my daughter's wand she had when she was in ballet as a tiny tyke. The instructors used the wands as a reward for the younger kids doing a good job and paying attention during the class, and then they could prance around with the wands. Rewards for doing what you want, is a good way to keep kids focussed, but this can work for anybody :D

As for the track, this was something I just slammed together pretty quickly... with a focus on a bit more ambient/sustaining sound... and then making it feel a bit more chopped up and a little glitchy.

When I got the sounds done, I ended up just making four sequences and moving between them. Yeah... I know... need to play out more content afterwards to make it pop more... maybe I will come back to it?

Keep on rocking folks!
