This week's [MPC Forums Beat Battle 306](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=210648) is still open for one more day. The track itself is a great mix of different synths, pads, chords, percussion, and other elements. You can go quite a few different ways for this beat battle for sure.

I worked on this track over a couple of days. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with it, but figured I'd dirty up the track a bit.

The first thing I did was hook up an FM broadcaster to my laptop, tuned in the OP-1 to the same station, and then recorded the audio over the airwaves. This gave the sound a bit more of that old time noise and grit, but also had the effect of making the track mono since the OP-1 doesn't record content in as stereo.

From there I just started scrubbing the OP-1 tape to listen for sounds that seemed like they could stand alone, or that I could filter a bit in order to help isolate some of the sounds. I really just focussed on the first 20 seconds of the track as the intro had most of the isolated sounds for chords, bass, pads, etc. Throughout a lot of the intro there is a rhythmic drum sound that I mostly just left in the samples. The drums were a bit more tricky and required some filtering to get rid of some of the other sounds of other instruments, but it was not too bad to work with.

So to get the different parts of the song out on the OP-1, I just kept scrubbing to the start and end points of sound and using the cut function. Once I liked the sound I would do a quick lift/drop to get the audio into the buffer, while also keeping the track coherent. Once I had the sample in the buffer, I then went to either the drum or synth sampler mode and dropped the sound into the sampler and started to experiment. Of the effects, I mostly used Nitro to get some filtering and resonance going and Phone to get some more glitched out effects. In particular for the drum sounds though, I ended up doing a few passes which required writing hits to tape and then cutting/lifting them to get them back into the sampler several times to commit some of the effects.

Once I had my sounds together I ended up making about ten four bar loops that I mostly played out by hand and wrote to tape loops on the OP-1. This got me the initial sound and song structure, but I wasn't really looking forward to lifting and dropping loops from the OP-1 tape in order to build up a full track. I have done it in the past, but it just seemed like it would be a hassle.

Instead, I decided to sample the loops one at a time into the MPC Live and then get back to chopping them up and playing out different variations. This didn't take too long, and gave me a chance to do some more sound design with the content. Once I had all the components done in the MPC as drum kits and key groups, I then moved on to laying out tracks and mixing everything together.

Overall I'd say it was pretty fun using both devices together, and I'll definitely look into doing it again. The tape track on the OP-1 definitely gives some different opportunities for music production, and I just know my way around the MPC so much better.
