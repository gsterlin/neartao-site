title: Longest Move Streak

The picture is of my dog Amy, she loves sun bathing after long walks. She just had her sixth birthday, so she deserves a little downtime now and then.

Well, today I hit a longest move streak of 45 days. That is probably 40 more days than any of my previous move streaks. I will admit, there have been a few days in there where I just didn't want to exercise. I had a late start, maybe got a mile into walking, and by the time I got home with the heat I just didn't want to go out again.

Staying motivated has come up a few times for me. A lot of this is because it is just very easy to say "what is one day?" I suppose I could make up for it the next day, or the day after, and that is both the point, and the issue.

The reality is true, the streak really doesn't matter because it is not the goal. The goal I have for myself is to get into better shape. Taking a day off is not an impediment to that goal directly, but I have also spent time thinking that perhaps it is the symbol. I have mentioned before and will say it again, it has been several years since I have done any physical activity regularly.

I used to hit the gym at work regularly, often three, but sometimes five days a week. That just about immediately ended when I decided to go back to school for my MBA about five years ago. Once I started my MBA, my life was consumed with getting everything out of it that I could, and as a result my personal life, my health, and my hobbies all took a back seat.

When I completed the MBA last year, it took me about a month to even be able to have a normal relationship with my wife again because we had drifted pretty far apart. We had expected this, and gotten used to about four years of me going to school, but I don't think we were prepared for how weird it would be to reconnect. With my hobbies taking a back seat, I also spent a lot of the last year trying to figure out what I wanted to do, as I have had many hobbies over the years, and I figured it was time to consolidate my interests.

All this is a long way to say both that I am happy that I am getting myself physically active again, and I am still working on pacing myself. It has been a long time coming, and oddly the pandemic has really helped me see the kind of spiral I was going down, just sitting at home, taking meetings, and not really moving much.

I am going to keep ticking that move streak up, but I'm not going to let it control my behavior either. What does that mean exactly? I am not sure, but for the time being I'm going to keep on getting out for walks, and I will start considering what other alternative exercises I can add to my repertoire.

Stay healthy!
