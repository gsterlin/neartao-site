This was a response I had for Danoc on the MPC Forums thread [Drum Techniques 4 Da MPC](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=198461).

I'm going to lead off with "if it sounds good, it is good". That doesn't mean that everybody else will like it, but it can be important to go with your gut. While chopping with a GUI sure is handy, it also can lead to some very 'same' chops. So if a chop that is early or late works for you, does not mean it is wrong.

This next one is harder, because a lot of music gets our ears warmed to "on the grid", but I would also say don't be afraid to turn timing correct off, play, and see what you get. There can be real magic to be found when you are not always on the grid, and seriously, human drummers are never 100% on the grid. An extreme of this is to track straight to audio, it is super frustrating at first, but it can really open up a world of possibilities in timing you had never known of. For this reason, I think it's important for everybody to have at least some experience with a looper of some sort. Similar to MPC 2/4/8 bar tracks, a looper can get you to lay out a pretty complete idea in short order. Better, if it can sync to midi you can use the two together and just go bananas.

If you want to sound authentic it is important to study what great drummers do, and how they do it. This requires listening to music, and don't be afraid to listen to the same song multiple times. Each listen can help you understand some nuances that you might not have heard before. Obviously it is easier to process a break, but that doesn't always mean it is the best part of the song to gravitate to, because the way the drums interact/groove/swing/etc with the rest of the music can help you learn new ideas and concepts.

Last point I'll add here is don't be afraid to go way outside the box. Sample sources don't need to be records or songs, why not beat box, make a recording session trying weird sounds with an empty water bottle, sample yourself beating the hell out of a garbage can. This is probably super obvious for a lot of you, but don't be afraid to pitch to extremes, you never know what kind of sounds you'll find, a short sound bite from tapping a glass with a spoon could sound like an epic drum hit detuned -24… you just never know.

I'm just leaving this here… because if this cannot help inspire you, I don't know what will. [https://www.thefutzbutler.com/news/the-20-best-drum-sounds-of-all-time/](https://www.thefutzbutler.com/news/the-20-best-drum-sounds-of-all-time/)
