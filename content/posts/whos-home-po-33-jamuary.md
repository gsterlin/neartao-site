I'm not really happy with this, but I also had a bit of a gap for #Jamuary. Guess it was too much to think I'd put something together every day. On the other hand, it is freeing to have just taken a few takes, and going for the best of them so that I can move on.

There really isn't anything too special here, and I actually sampled way more than I ended up using. Some of the other tracks I've posted I've been thinking of going back and actually tracking them out and mixing them up a bit, but this one I was super into last week, and now it just kind of falls flat for me.

Another thing of note, I decided not to use any of the PO-33 FX, and it was probably the right call in this case, I wasn't exactly feeling the track, and while the PO-33 FX can add some fun, it helps to enjoy jamming with the track.

My last note, I usually spend time balancing out the guitar pedal effects, but you can very clearly hear that the audio levels bounce around. I am not proud of this, but again, probably best to just get something down and out sometimes. It's now time to move on from this track and start recording in some more samples :D
