There weren't any other entries, so I figured what the heck and put together a track.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/mpcbb298-relaxing-action

The sample itself was pretty basic, so I figured I would work on chopping it up and just finding a drum kit to play to it. I wanted to focus as much as possible on keeping the original audio track playing throughout the track without it sounding too repetitive, this meant making variations to work through, and seeing what worked. Ultimately I wanted some of the shorter chops to play longer through this process, so a quick detune of 6 semitones had me pretty well sorted so that I didn't have any gaps of silence.

Near the back half of the track I also played around with having multiple sections playing the same program play at the same time just to see how it came out. With the chopped/flipped sample program being set to mono this worked out well enough, but I'm not sure it would have worked in my favor had the program been polyphonic.

Now to sit back and see what the other entrants do for their track :D
