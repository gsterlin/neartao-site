title: Akai S950 String Program For MPC Live/X

Hey everybody!

Today I spent some time trimming recording in a string sample into the Akai S950.  It was about 20 seconds or so long.  The idea was to make something that could be pitched up reasonably high and still have a reasonable length to it.

Once I completed sampling into the S950, I used my Akai MPC Live to create a mono sampled key group patch from the content.  The auto sampler tried to put in loop points, but they were completed busted, so I disabled sample looping.  I have to say, I do like some of the sounds in the lower keys (C0-C1), as the stretching from the S950 sounds pretty heavy and dark.

You can download the content at [S950 Strings](/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/s950-strings.zip "S950 Strings") and extract the .zip file into your media of choice on the MPC Live/X.  The samples are .wav format, so you can load them into your sampler of choice even if you don't have an MPC Live/X.  If you end up using the sound in anything you create drop it in the comments below!
