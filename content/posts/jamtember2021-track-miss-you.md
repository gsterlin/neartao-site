Had a slightly longer lunch break than intended, but came to this track as an end point.

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/miss-you

The picture is another one from the walk. Just some train tracks that I had to walk over, and look like a good time to snap a quick picture.

More importantly though, what I had for lunch. Chicken Tikka Masala, and boy did it hit the spot! Sure it was store bought, packaged, and needed to be reheated, but it is what I had available at the time, or I could have had some fajita leftovers, but I think I am saving those for tonight.

The track itself came together pretty quickly. I tried playing with the pitch of the drums, but instead just did some subtle filtering just to put the hits in the pocket a little bit more. The piano loops were just something I grabbed out of the old sample library, made sure they were in key, and I knew the key, and then messed with region chopping to get something that seemed workable for me.

Bass though... I wanted to mess around with Hype a bit more... I really really really however wanted to use the Moog Voyager... but all my cables that are long enough are packed up... so whatever. Went with Hype, dialed in the key, and went to town playing the pads. Initially the sound was just long sustained notes which worked really well, especially with the gliding, but I decided to try using filter gates, eighth note dotted, sixteenth notes, all kinds of stuff was tried. In the end I settled for quarter notes. I was going to fix the gliding notes, but it did give some of the notes a kind of cool effect, so \*shrug\*... it got left in.

Ran the track through Yorgos' Mastering (as is the usual). It's a tad toasty... so some of the noise probably ought to get filtered out... but whatever. It is here and it is how I like it :D
