title: Disable Q-Link Overlay on Akai MPC Live/One
url: /2021/02/19/disable-q-link-overlay-on-akai-mpc-live-one/

---
Folks seem to be unhappy with the Q-Link overlay that was added into the Akai MPC Live/Live II/One firmware. While it is handy, it can put this overlay over the end of a sample you are trying to edit as soon as you touch the Q-Link, and can be about as annoying as it is helpful.

To turn it off, you'll need to get into the Preferences Menu, go into General, and scroll down to the bottom and look for "SHOW QLINK STATUS WHEN TOUCHED", and remove the check mark. This will enable/disable this feature.

If you're looking for more information, definitely check out the [Akai MPC Live/X/One 2.9 Manual](https://www.akaipro.com/amfile/file/download/file/1118/product/10/).

Below is the page you can read about the setting on page 83. I've outlined the relevant text in red.
