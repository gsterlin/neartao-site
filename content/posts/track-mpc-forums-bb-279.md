I have been trying to get back into flipping samples again lately, and done a few other beat battles. Maybe I'll post them. If you're interested in seeing some of the discussion and submissions check out the [MPC Forums BB 279 Thread](https://www.mpc-forums.com/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=197867). There's definitely a lot of good content there, and some really great flips.

My approach has been to just spend 60-90 minutes on each battle, so instead of trying to get a full track or perfect mix, just go for speed of getting something workable and putting it together quickly. This battle was no different, and while I'm not excited for the track exactly, it was fun.

Danoc provided the track from Diana Ross "Ain't No Mountain High Enough", which is an excellent track on its own, with plenty of material to pull from no matter how you want you want to approach it. My approach was to listen to the track a few times and take some notes and pull some hits/loops. Initially I was considering taking some full on portions of the song and mixing them, but what I ended up gravitating to was some of the bass note hits I could isolate, the strings were pretty easy to grab at the start, and I was able to almost get a few isolated hits out of the break.

Beyond that, I found some pretty easy to sample vocal loops both with and without drums that looped well. In the end though, I just chopped the vocals to be just usable enough without having to EQ or try other tricks to get it to extract well. There was a bit of a fight with some of the reverb tails, but when you settled the vocal hits into the mix it was hardly an issue.

I tried, tried, tried to get a kick out of it, but I ended up making mostly a bassy hit, which is pretty prominent in the track, but I had to go through my sample library to source a complimentary kick and layer them to get more impact.

I was initially aiming for a 96bpm mix, but I wanted to make it a bit darker, and ended up dropping the Diana Ross clips by 3 semitones. It sounded much darker, but also (as you'll know if you've done this) had the sound effect of making the length of all of the hits go longer, so to solve this I dropped the BPM until it sounded good. This ended up with a track speed of 75bpm.

The next step was to find a vocal rap, and this is where I found Eminem 3 a.m. would fit in nicely. I loaded up Spleeter to get the vocal track as best I could. As I mentioned before, it totally has that spectralness to it that sounds weird, but I was hoping settling it into the mix it wouldn't be too obvious. I guess see for yourself what you think. Instead of focusing on dropping the full rap in, I just grabbed out to main sections, and then grabbed some of the intro vocals to mix throughout and then dropped it into a song.

To make the intro, main, and outro I didn't really doing anything magical, it was just removing a few sections to make it sound like a build up and drop, but it was the lazy version. I definitely could have orchestrated things better, but I was running out of time, and didn't even spend much time mixing, and definitely did not get to mastering.

Overall I'm happy with my output, but there are some really good tracks dropped in the forum. If you get a chance check it out. In the meantime, here's my track!
