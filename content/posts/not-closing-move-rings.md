title: Not closing move rings...

So here is a bit of a quandary for me. About a week and a half ago I hit a 59 day streak for closing all of the rings on the Apple Watch, and then it stopped. In the last two weeks I have not been closing all of my rings despite my exercise right being frequently over flowing. What is going on?

I spent some time thinking about this and if I should be upset with myself or not. I had been really looking to get healthier over the last few months, and boy do I feel like I have in some ways disappointed myself by not closing all of the rings. As with many things in life though, I had to spend some time considering why this may not be the case.

On average, I am not exercising about 50 minutes a day, which is \*much\* higher than I have been doing in the past by a large margin. Before the pandemic I was likely to get 10-15 minutes of exercise, and now I am at least tripling that. This feels really great, and I do feel like I have far more energy lately, no complaints here. This lead me to thinking about what is up and what is going on?

I have been looking into the Apple Watch data for my exercises, and I have come to the conclusion that my heart rate is much lower for doing the exact same exercises I have been doing over the last two months. This is absolutely a good thing, and indicates to me that my heart and lung health is getting much better. The interesting thing is that the way that the move ring is representing this is that I am burning fewer calories, hence why my move ring is not closing lately, for the same amount of effort.

Some of this has been due to taking my dogs out for a walk, and they just naturally slow things down because of needing to stop for them to go to the bathroom, let them smell something interesting, or having to stop while we let a vehicle drive by.

All of these things are telling me good things about the exercise I have taken, but it is also showing me that it is time for me to start varying my exercise activity so that I push myself more. I think I am going to start by adding a jog into my routine instead of just walking, and see how that changes things.

The great thing about having all of this data is that you can dig into it as much as you want, and interpret as it makes sense for you. Am I thinking about the data the right way or wrong way for myself? I think I am mostly getting it right, though as I work through this and run myself through some experiments only time will tell how it changes for me.
