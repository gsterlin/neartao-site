Day 2

https://soundcloud.com/neartao/productive-pillow

This track was something I had just made a two bar section... and really liked it a month or so back, but just didn't really know where to go with it. In order to complete my track a day I figured it is completely fine to dig up old material and put it together. This is another track done entirely on the Akai MPC mk2, and this time no fun mastering. It's mixed closer to the way I wanted it, and I didn't feel it needed any oomph to the track, though I say that and have re-listened to it a few times and kind of question my decision. It might've benefited from another round of processing, but hey gotta keep moving forward.

I'm not sure I'd totally put this under a house track per se, but it's got a fair share of those elements... so even if it isn't tagged \*quite\* right, I suspect it'll be good enough. Anyway... I suspect I'll be pulling a fair number of unfinished tracks over this month to keep up, but it is worthwhile to dig through all those fun little ideas and snippets to see what can come of it if anything. And... since this is a month of just moving forward for me, well... if it isn't great, my excuse is that I only had a handful of hours to pull it together while balancing life, family, work, and dropping hopefully cool beats.
