This site is totally an experiment for me at the moment... something that I started over eight years ago when I was having a really creative time doing artwork and music.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue the original site, so I let it fall into tragic disrepair, and somebody bought the site name out from under me.  My fault... so I'll deal with it, but now I need to take the time to get back to where I was.  At some point I'll get this page along with others updated, but for now this is was it is.

If you're looking to contact me, for the time being [neartao@gmail.com](mailto:neartao@gmail.com) is probably the easiest way to reach out to me.  As things settle in I'll take some time to think about what this site means to me.
